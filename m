Please do.

I was hoping to spread as many of these around as possible so I don't
end up with a giant pull request to Linus.  There is code out there
without a clear maintainership path, so eventually I'll have to send
some his way (or via akpm) but the less that end up in that pile, the
better IMHO.

Thanks,
Paul.
