sdhci-s3c isn't the only driver that's going to have options for
different cd configurations -- maybe now is the right time to move
these options into the core bindings?

At OLPC we've just started using:

 * "broken-cd" to mean "samsung,sdhci-cd-none",
 
 * the presence of a "cd-gpios" property to imply "samsung,sdhci-cd-gpio".
   
 * "non-removable" to mean "samsung,sdhci-cd-permanent" (this is already
   specified in mmc.txt)

Would these work for you?

We don't have a distinction between sdhci-cd-internal and sdhci-cd-gpio,
and I'm having trouble working out why one is necessary.  Why does the
driver need to know where the gpio came from, aside from knowing which
gpio it is and whether it needs to be inverted (with cd-inverted)?

Thanks,

- Chris.
