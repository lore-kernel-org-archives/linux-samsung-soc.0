Then "component-color-bpp" perhaps?

True.

It goes beyond bindings IMO. The use of the component framework or not
has been at the whim of driver writers as well. It is either used or
private APIs are created. I'm using components and my need for it
boils down to passing the struct drm_device pointer to the encoder.
Other components like panels and bridges have different ways to attach
to the DRM driver.

Certainly, and I will take some blame here. We deferred a lot of
binding review to subsystem maintainers with the directive to ask for
help when needed. The latter has not happened. We need to improve the
situation here before we end up with a bigger mess. The momentum to
use DRM on Android is growing, so the problem is only going to get
worse if we do nothing.
