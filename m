Can we maybe settle on the naming then so that we do not mix them up in
the future? For me PM domain is group of devices that share certain
power constraints so that they have to be powered up and down together.
Is this definition is not correct (for genpd at least)? And what is the
proper definition for ACPI PM domain?

Thanks.
