My understanding is that the hierarchy of struct generic_pm_domain
is created by the platform on boot.  For an embedded platform, this
is encoded in the device tree, but what about ACPI which doesn't
know anything about struct generic_pm_domain?  I would have to lump
devices into generic_pm_domains after the fact, after the platform
has scanned the buses, but this seems to be forbidden according to
this slide deck, which calls that a "layering violation":

https://events.linuxfoundation.org/images/stories/pdf/lcjp2012_wysocki.pdf

(Quote: "Adding and Removing Devices [...] Supposed to be called by
the platform (calling one of them from a device driver is a layering
violation).")

So it seems that using struct generic_pm_domain is never an option
on ACPI, is that correct?

Thanks,

Lukas
