Ok, I will check it soon then.

This is required for S5PV210 which has no iommu and requires contiguous=
 memory=20
from 2 separate physical memory banks. It use dma_declare_coherent to d=
efine
memory for each bus separately. One platform device can have only one c=
oherent
memory range defined, that's why there are two devices created.

Exynos4210 has 2 iommu controllers for MFC device - one for each memory=
 bus.=20
Each MFC bus can address 128MiB of IO address space. Do you mean that t=
he new driver
will merge these 2 controllers into one? This way we will lose half of =
address space
for MFC device.
