Indeed, I was also a bit surprised we still need non-dt support, since
migration to this generic PHY framework in case of exynos was solely
part of migration of the whole platform to DT.

Two of the drivers that are being converted are also used on s5pv210,
but there is currently no boards in mainline that would use devices
covered by those drivers and s5pv210 will very likely get DT support
in v3.13 anyway.

But it seems omap still needs non-dt support in the PHY framework.
