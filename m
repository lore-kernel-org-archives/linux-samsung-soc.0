Right, so any call that holds prepare_lock and might touch the hardware
needs to first call pm_runtime_get_sync.

I agree with the above, but I'm also wondering about the folks that use
regmap internally to their own clock provider drivers. I guess they will
have the option to either do their own thing or use this framework-level
solution.

I've started reviewing the code itself and will respond to those mails
separately.

Thanks,
