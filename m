Finally, here is the implementation Hans and I agreed on. Plus, all potential
users I could spot already converted. Renesas R-Car driver was added on top.
This series was tested on a Renesas Lager board (R-Car H2). I had to hack some
error cases into the code to verify the workings. Thanks for all the tests so
far. Of course, more testing never hurts ;)

Please comment, review, test... a branch can be found here:

Thanks,

Changes since RFC:

* don't use bitfields anymore but an unsigned long flags variable which is only
  meant for flags to be changed when the adapter lock is held

* split the genereic accessor into _mark_suspended() and _mark_resumed()

* added kerneldoc and noted that using these helpers is optional

* documented -ESHUTDOWN as the error code when trying to transfer using an
  already suspended adapter

* added acks from last series. Changes were minor enough to keep them. Please let
  me know if you disagree.
