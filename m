I guess it would also be useful to have some way to compare what's in
-next with what's in the arm-soc tree and chase people if that diff gets
big.  I do also wonder if it's worth letting people push stuff to you
more aggressively - right now you seem to be asking people to batch
things up and I wonder if that's making it a it easier for things to end
up dropping on the floor if a time based routine isn't working well for
people.

It's not just me, I'm just vocal and perhaps more to the point spend a
reasonable amount of time chasing stuff into various trees so want to
figure out if I need to change what I'm doing with that.
