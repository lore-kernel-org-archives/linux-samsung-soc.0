That does solve the issue of parsing those same values over and over,
but at the cost of making the binding a lot more conceptually complex.

However, it doesn't solve any of the extensibility issues I raised such
as whether pos+size or mask would be a better representation, what about
if the fields end up being in different (separate) registers on newer
SoCs, etc.

I forget, do you actually have multiple different SoCs right now (or in
the near future where the HW design is known now for certain even if the
chip isn't available) that have different values for all these *-width
properties and hence can be represented just using this binding and
without altering the driver at all? If so, I suppose the original
binding is at least useful (although I would certainly still request to
use *-mask instead of *-width properties).
