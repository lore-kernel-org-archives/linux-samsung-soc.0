How about a property using 'cd-external' property in place of
'external-cd-gpios'.  'cd-external' would mean that the gpio listed by
'cd-gpios' is a gpio line which is not connected the card-detect pad
of the mmc controller.

This can simplfy the dt parsing code since it is required to look for
only one gpio property, which is 'cd-gpios' which implies lesser error
handling code. 'cd-external' can qualify it further as an external cd
pin.

Either way, I am fine with the binding you have proposed. If you post
a patch for these new bindings, I will base the sdhci-s3c dt patch on
top of that patch.

Thanks,
Thomas.
