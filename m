Yeah, I detected these since I'm preparing a series to reduce the delta
between exynos_defconfig and multi_v7_defconfig. And found these issues
since current multi_v7 policy is to build as much as possible as a module.
 
I think is unfortunate how many drivers are not providing proper module
aliases information and so building them as a module is less useful since
user-space can't associate the module with the modalias uevents to autoload.

Anyway, I'll take a look for other drivers and see if I can post similar
patches but now at least all the peripherals in the Exynos5 Chromebooks
are working when their drivers are built as a module.
