OK, so disabling the mdma0 node in "arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5420.dtsi"
gets things working. Like Kevin mentioned in the initial report, I
need to disable DRM else there is a crash while suspending. With these
two changes, on linus' tree and kgene's for-next s2r works fine.

On linux-next, I need to disable CONFIG_MWIFIEX too.

Also, I observe cros-ec-spi transfer failures during resume and
sometimes it is unable to re-enable the tps fets causing a crash.
However, that would be a driver specific issue.

Regarding the mdma0 disablement, it looks like for the system to
suspend properly the mdma0 pclk needs to stay on.
