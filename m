Oh, no question about the hack status. The trouble is, unless there is a
sure way to tell which SoC revision we're running on, there's little
else we can do than poke both locations and pray.

Is there such a way to identify the SoC revision?

Well, I thought I was the uber-cool guy in the office because of that
shiny blue board on my desk, only to discover that it's sooo last
year... ;-)

The only documentation I have access to refers to the iRAM (SRAM) being
mapped between 0x02020000 and 0x02040000. Unless the HW guys have gone
completely wild and changed this range as well, I think we're pretty
safe.

No. Anything will do. Though not being able to ioremap() that region may
indicate further trouble down the road.
