OK. How much of that memory does the kernel need to know about then?

Surely the kernel shouldn't be able to map the EL3 monitor or hypervisor
at all?

What address is the kernel getting loaded at if everything up to
0x8C400000 isn't usable?

While that might be sufficient for the device to function, Linux doesn't
know that from this DT, and as far as I can see the device can't
possibly probe, as no clocks are provided through platform data:

of_platform_bus_create will call of_amba_device_create for anyting
compatible with "arm,primecell". This in turn will call amba_device_add,
which will call amba_get_enable_pclk. Then clk_get(&pcdev->dev,
"apb_pclk") should fail, amba_device_add should fail, and
of_platform_bus_create will stop trying to probe the node.
of_platform_populate will carry on probing other nodes.

Surely the pl011 nodes at least need "apb_pclk"?

Cheers,
Mark.
