As far as I'm aware of, all Exynos4412-based ODROIDs run secure
firmware, which needs special handling of suspend/resume. I already have
a series to address this, but there is one more issue that I'd like to
fix, until I send it. The patches should hit the ML this week, though.

Best regards,
Tomasz
