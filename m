Correct.

Also as an extra side note, intallow is used here as a mask of valid 
eintmask bits on given platform. On Exynos SoCs there are 32 EINTs, so 
this extra mask is not needed.

This is configurable. There is a bit that determines whether it should 
switch back to normal config automatically or not. What's interesting is 
that AFAIR current code uses automatic switch, which even with the glitch 
prevention in resume can glitch things, due to the period of time between 
wake-up and resume when pins are misconfigured.

I think we should just configure this bit for manual switch back and 
trigger the switch from .resumed() callback of the pin controller in 
pinctrl-s3c64xx driver. I will post a patch for this some day.

Let's see. If nobody takes this until Monday, which is very likely, I will 
send new version.

Thanks.
