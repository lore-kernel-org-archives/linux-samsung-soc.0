Hmm, the common clock framework is designed to account for late 
registration of parent clocks. Fixed rate clocks defined from DT seem to 
work fine for S3C64xx and Exynos5410 (patches posted some time ago by 
Tarek Dakhran). I'm not sure why it doesn't work for you.

OK. Just wanted to make sure that they are real clocks found in the SoC, 
as I don't have access to Exynos 5420 datasheet yet.

It's OK for core system peripherals, such as lpddr, monocnt, mif, drex, 
intmem, etc. I'm not sure about the two display clocks. Respective 
drivers should be fixed to gate them correctly, but for now maybe it's 
OK to keep them enabled. However I believe it's wrong for sclk_uart's.

Looking at the code, Samsung serial driver enables selected baud clock 
properly, so I don't see any reason why sclk_uart clocks should have 
this flag set. Are you sure you have correct clock look-up in your DT?

Should be fine.
