If you don't know the use cases, and the use cases are not in the
kernel tree that we care about here (upstream), then there's really
nothing to worry about. It's after all just a define that's moved to
an ioremap, if there's some out of tree code that needs the old legacy
define then it can be added in whatever out-of-tree code that uses it.
Right?

What do you expect is required to clarify the situation, and when do
you expect that to happen?
