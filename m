Yes, looks like I missed that. There are the changes I had:

These changes gave me CG_STATUS0[22:21] as 0. I noticed that of the 2
CG_STATUS0 bits one did not turn 0 even when the mdma0 clock was kept
on. I decided to add the clock slimsss as it was the other clock
sourced from aclk266_g2d and noticed that the other bits turned 0.

Yes, though it increasingly looks like aclk266_g2d needs to stay ON
and we should use your patch that keeps it enabled prior to suspend.
