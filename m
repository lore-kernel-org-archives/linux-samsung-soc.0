Sure, I will re-send 'pull request' with separated topic branches.

I'm not sure which commits are cleanups what you said, but let me sort 
them out again when I re-send.

Yes, you're right. There are discussions about Nicolas' patch when it 
was submitted and since it was not available at that time, it has been 
added into my tree before 3.2 merge window. Anyway, let me sort it out.

Well, I think it should be included in next/devel branch, because they 
are developing of Cragganmore boards not adding new board which is the 
purpose of next/board branch what you said. But if you want it, I will.

Okay, I will.

Let me sort our my branches soon :)

Thanks.
