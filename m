Be aware that we might be talking here about savings of single 
milliamperes, because the highest, dynamic, power consumption is already 
bypassed in WFI idle mode, with stopped core clock.

Our measurements have shown that static leakage is pretty low on SoCs we 
checked, that is Exynos 4210 and Exynos 4412. I don't remember exactly 
ATM, because it was some time ago, but it was something around 2 mA per 
core.

Now it depends on overall power consumption of given system, whether such 
saving is significant or ignorable - in our case it is the latter, because 
consumption caused by rest of the system (think of display, wireless 
radios, etc.) is much higher.

See my other reply, for a bit more information about this state and CPU1 
restriction.

Yes, there are other states as well. With similar execution flow, but 
different set of preserved and lost context, requiring more or less save 
and restore on kernel side.

In this case just simple power down of CPU cores is enough, which doesn't 
require entering system-wide low power state, such as AFTR and friends. 
Such low power mode is needed only when you want to power off all the 
cores, which makes you lose program execution state.

When at least one of the cores is still active, the whole system is in 
control of kernel and no special care must be taken to bring up cores that 
are down and back, just standard SMP/hotplug ops.
