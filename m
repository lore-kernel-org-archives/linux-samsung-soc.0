The real patch has been split into two for easier merging: 1. the driver
part and 2. samsung platform related part. The part which patch belongs
to is indicated in the last line of the change log.

I'm really confused how to submit properly a patch that requires changes
to both the driver (which is merged by the proper driver maintainer's
sub-tree) and the platform (which should go through platform maintainer's
tree).

Ok, I will add something like "(platform changes)" to the patch title next time.
