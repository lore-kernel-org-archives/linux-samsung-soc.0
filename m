Oh, you are still alive? I thought you were about to get married :)
Just kidding !!

Hmm, yeah if we can. I haven't found a easy way to go ahead and then
got caught in other activities.

Ok, I believe the FIXME is a bit outdated. From the code I can see only
this limitation.

- For every cluster, the cpu which boots up first should carry the OPPs.
Otherwise there is no restriction on ordering of CPUs.

- I believe CPUs boot in the order they are present in DT except for the
boot CPU. So, the first node for every cluster should have it.

Correct ? Then we can update the fixme.

Hmm, I never thought about it. But yes the CPU with the OPPs should
be the first one to come back.

They are just stuck and went nowhere :(
