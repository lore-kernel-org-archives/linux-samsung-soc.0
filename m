Hi Kevin,

Thanks for taking a look at this.

No, it has not. In general it was already too late in the release cycle
when the last version was posted.

I had a plan to take it through clock tree with Kukjin's and Viresh's
cooperation, but now as you say it...

I'd definitely like to see a clarification on this issues, before this
series hits mainline or at least its parts related to affected SoCs.
Also I'd like to hear some confirmation from Samsung Poland R&D Center
guys (on CC), whether this code works stable on their target boards
(Universal C210, Trats, Trats2).

The patch looks fine to me (well, it's trivial :)), thanks.

Best regards,
Tomasz
