Although bisect complained about this patch but I am not convinced
that it is the cause. Before the patch the constraints were not
applied. To none of the regulators. With the patch the constraints are
applied to bucks... which are not directly used by SD card.

Instead some of the bucks are apparently supplying other LDOs. I
suspect buck9 which is mentioned as a supply for VDD 2.8V (2.8V
happens to be also the voltage of regulators going to SD card).
With the patch following constraints are applied:
                 target_min, target max, current
setting BUCK1 to 1100000 1100000 1100000
setting BUCK2 to 1000000 1000000 1000000
setting BUCK3 to 1000000 1000000 1000000
setting BUCK4 to 1000000 1000000 1000000
setting BUCK5 to 1200000 1200000 1200000
setting BUCK6 to 1025000 1025000 1025000
setting BUCK7 to 900000 900000 900000
setting BUCK8 to 1225000 1225000 1225000
setting BUCK9 to 3750000 3750000 5000000

Why the heck current_uV is 5V? I'll try to figure this out...

Best regards,
Krzysztof
