First, thanks for doing this work.

This "device hierarchy" was rather confusing to grasp, I specially hard
a hard time understanding *why* the device links work did not do any
topological sorting at all. I'm also afraid this is not just "tribal
knowledge" -- not everyone was able to answer my questions about these
things, Rafafel however did do justice to some degree and I did provide notes
from this. I think it would be important then to jot down to help humans
grok:

  o where the implicit order we embrace comes from
  o what mechanisms are used to help provide some of this order
  o why this is *not* sufficient

The last one justifies the work. And more importantly, it may help
replace a whole bunch of other parallel work which had similar type of
solutions. To what extent it can do that well remains to be seen but
from what I can tell, that's future work worth looking into.

Well you also forgot to mention the issues with deferred probe. It uses
deferred probe so if for whatever reason your subsystem or driver has issues
with it, this won't help.

Here is an example of current mechanisms used which to driver developers
provides implicit order --its all magical. This has can have limitations,
its important to annotate how this is limiting and also why this perhaps
was not considered as an enhancement in ACPI space. Ie, if semantics
existed in ACPI space for dependency info, why are we now left to our hims
for some cases on driver code?

I provided a list of other frameworks in the kernel which have
their own solutions which are worth looking into, if anything to at
least determine if we have older frameworks to replace or to use
them to help complement device links framework to help with other
areas other "firmware tools" clearly are lacking.

<insert sarcasm>

Oh look a DAG without any sort. How did that happen?

And where did order from that come from? My notes provided answers to
these questions.
