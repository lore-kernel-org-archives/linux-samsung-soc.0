I think it's really problematic to retroactively mark a binding as unstable.
The best way to do it is probably at the time of introduction if you anticipate
it needing adjustments down the road (i.e. if it's for a complex IP block).

For major overhauls, it might be worth updating to a new binding instead (by
appending a suffix to the name or similar, and documenting that).

I think that sets up for a pretty bad experience for some downstream users.

The main problem with unstable bindings is if you have a platform that you
haven't (yet) upstreamed the devicetrees for. Moving around base kernel
versions in those cases can be really awkward.

"Just upstream your devicetrees" is one counter-argument, but it's not always
that easy -- it might be unreleased products or just some experimental
platforms that might even be tracking fairly close to mainline during whatever
development is ongoing.

Yeah, adding them with unstable up front is a good way to do it (and then
remove that warning once things have settled down).

In some cases it's pretty easy to stay backwards compatible by making sure
that things like missing properties have the same defaults as they used to
before the properties became mandatory.

For complex subsystems it might be a different story, but that's also where it
_might_ be worth looking at a new revision of the binding instead, this time
maybe closer to a permanent one.

Marek, do you have any good examples here? Could still be useful.
