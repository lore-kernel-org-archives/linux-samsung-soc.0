Ok

I'm fine with it either way. Russell, if you like you can merge
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kgene/linux-samsung v3.19-next/pm-samsung-2
into your tree and resolve the conflict on your end, we have a stable
copy of that branch queued in next/soc.

If you prefer v8 to go through arm-soc, that's fine with me too, or
we could share a branch with v9 of Marek's series and have that merged
into arm-soc/next/soc to resolve the conflict.
