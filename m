You wouldn't find in cpufreq-dt documentation as its not specific to
that. I have seen you DT patches now, and you have created the OPP
tables mostly correctly. Just create the cpufreq-platform device for
cpufreq-dt instead of arm-big-little one. And it should just work.

I am not talking about any future plans here that need some work to be
done. Its all working today, you just need to use a different driver.

I think this is the right time to upstream the right solution. Just
try it once, if you face lots of difficulties or issues, then we can
ofcourse see..

NOTE: Check how OPP nodes are required to be created now in
linux-next. They should be named like opp@<freq-hz>. Something I
noticed in your DTs.
