[note: earlier on this thread I assumed linux-arm-kernel was on
vger.kernel.org, so the patch was initially sent to the wrong address.
When I resend, I will be sure to use the correct list address]

Krzystztof--

Thank you for your review.  I appreciate your patience as I've not
worked on devicetree files before.

OK, I will in an V2.

Yes, it seems to (I have about 20 or so cycles on it in informal test).

I have no idea what the actual hardware is-- this pin is not mentioned
in the module datasheet and there is no schematic.  I found it through
exploring an upstream vendor kernel.  It's altogether possible this is
"naughty" but it seems to work OK.

I'll check if non-removable works.  I remember it not working once,
but I had other problems in my testing.

This is the vmmc supply, not vqmmc-- that would be for vqmmc, right
(and signalling speed).  The card says it wants a range of vmmc
voltages, but the actual regulator is forced to 1.8V, and 1.8V is not
one of those voltages.  So absent a new quirk, I think I need to nail
the regulator on.

It enumerates the card currently and then uses the card product
information to load brcmfmac.  Is there a reason to put a description
of the actual card in?
