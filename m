I don't think so.
You argues that the wrong code should not be removed because it was acc=
epted and at least it's working.
It is just wrong usage, which can just work.
Moreover, your code will make the problem, when 2~5 windows of FIMD IP =
are used.
So, your code can be removed.

Augulis, Thomas Abraham wants to rework s3c-fb platform data and driver=
 framework, not me. :)
I am just reviewing the Thomas's patchset.

However, skipping step 1 & 2 is also available, because your code is wr=
ong.
As I'm mentioned above, your code will make the problem when 2~5 window=
s of FIMD IP are used.
