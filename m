OK, I managed to get an exynos5800-peach-pi up and running.  I put my
patch in place and am currently at 45 reboots and counting w/ no
problems.

NOTE: in my case I actually had to disable "hs400" mode on my peach-pi
but that's because the board I dug up was an early version of the
board that didn't have the strobe line connected.  However, Alim's
earlier reports of problems were with hs200 anyway and hs200 still
executes the tuning plenty of times.  His reports of problems also
said that he had problems after just a few boots.

So I'll assert that whatever problems were present 4 years ago have
indeed gone away.  I'll leave rebooting happening overnight just in
case, but otherwise I'll assert that this is fine.
