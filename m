Exactly what I've been saying.

OTOH seeing the intricate fixes that Javi submitted to the core,
is impressive. Being the author of code, I sense Javi
has far better understanding of PL330 and the driver.

OK, but that may not be scalable considering next year too someone
could want to update the copyright to 2013 and so on.
So I suggested simply change 2010 to 2010-2012 in the existing notice.

Based on the LOC stats, maybe. But not on the quality of patches.
I say let's add Javi and Boojin both.

I meant Kukjin is defending co-ownership of Boojin on the basis of this merge.

Actually I know more than the history of file. I have worked with Boojin.

Btw _every_ file involved in the merger is authored by me, so we are not
at the risk of wiping out credit log of someone's contribution.
Anyways, I think I can live with that piece of history stuck to the
file forever.
