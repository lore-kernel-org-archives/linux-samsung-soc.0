Which my reply you are referring to? You stripped part of some
sentence and put it without *any context*. Just random sentence.
I asked for vendor prefix in few places... srom-timing? width? And I
do not remember where I used exactly these words. This is why
*context* is needed.

Yep, selecting some sentences and replying only to them, leaving the
context away, is highly confusing. I reply in different places,
sometimes asking for similar things. Removing context messes this up.
In the same time all of my other questions are being removed without
any acknowledgment so I do not know if they were ignored or just
silently acked.

I show you example:

>  I just don't know...
I don't know neither.

> If someone wants to get the whole picture, he/she could just browse back to the start of the thread.
Yes, I would just scroll up and see the context. No, wait. There is no
context. I have to find mine original email and compare which part was
ignored, which was applied and which quoted sentence you are referring
to.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
