Okay more on this. I fixed xf86-video-armso to ask for EXYNOS_BO_CONTIG
for ARMSOC_BO_SCANOUT and EXYNOS_BO_NONCONTIG in all other cases.

Revert of the commit: 3be1f6273441fe95dd442f44064387322e16b7e9

With this change, now display manager starts just fine. However, it turns
out xf86-video-armsoc is obsoleted in favor of xf86-video-modesetting. The
last update to xf86-video-armsoc git was 3 years ago.

I am not sure where to send the fix and doesn't look like it is being
maintained actively. I can pursue it further and try to get this into
xf86-video-armsoc provided I can find the maintainer for this seemingly
inactive project.

I brought in the latest xf86-video-modesetting bits from

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-modesetting

I removed xf86-video-armsoc and installed xf86-video-modesetting and that
worked just fine. xf86-video-modesetting uses dumb_create interface instead
of DRM_IOCTL_EXYNOS_GEM_CREATE.

dumb_create interface eliminates the need for DRM_IOCTL_EXYNOS_GEM_CREATE
in userspace. libdrm-2.4.71 does call DRM_IOCTL_EXYNOS_GEM_CREATE.

The question is do we still need to continue to support the custom gem
create interface DRM_IOCTL_EXYNOS_GEM_CREATE? Some drm drivers seem to
support it and some don't. Unfortunately, if userspace requests noncontig
for scanout, we will continue to see problems with display manager when
iommu is disabled. dumb create hides all of that, are there good reasons
to continue to support it in exynos drm?

Exposing CONTIG and NONCONTIG to userspace appears to be causing problems
when exynos drm determines it can't support non-contig GEM buffers in fb
init after userspace allocates them.

exynos_drm_gem_dumb_create() doesn't take any flags, there is no need
to change the above.
