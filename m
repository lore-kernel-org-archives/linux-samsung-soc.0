I'm sorry about late reply.

I didn't ask any help to firmware engineer because I didn't know who firmware engineer
and also didn't access the source code. If I knew the engineer and can access them,
I would have asked some help to them or inquired the reason about CPU0 not hotplugged.

Unfortunately, I don't know correctly why Exynos SoC cannot hotplug the CPU0.
But, IMHO, SoC had to maintain at least online core for operation.
Just Exynos SoC has remained the CPU0 as at least online core.
