I agree that we loose the "burst" mode but:
1. At least on Exynso4 SSS is part of TOP power domain so it will not
   help to reduce any more power consumption (on Exynos5422 it is
   mentioned in G2D... which seems incorrect).
2. I think the overhead of clk operations is much smaller. These are only
   two locks (prepare mutex + enable spin), simple tree traversal and
   play with few SFRs.

   The power domain code in comparison to that is huge and complicated
   with inter-device links and dependencies. Also the actual runtime PM
   suspend would anyway fall back at then end to clk prepare/enable
   locks and paths.

   We've been talking about this a lot with Marek Szyprowski (cc'ed) and
   he was always (AFAIR) against attempts of runtime power
   management of a single clock...

No problem. Number is chosen arbitrarily so there will not be any
additional information coming from the define.

I really do not like global or file-scope variables. I do not like
drivers using them. Actually I hate them.

>From time to time I encounter a driver which was designed with that
approach - static fields and hidden assumption that there will be only
one instance. Usually that assumption is really hidden...

... and then it happens that I want to use two instances which of course
fails.

This code serves as a clear documentation for this assumption - only one
instance is allowed. You can look at it as a self-documenting
requirement.

And I think the probe might be called twice, for example in case of
mistake in DTB.
