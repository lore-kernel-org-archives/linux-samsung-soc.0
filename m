If input rate(f_in) gets changed for PLL, then the corresponding
output rates(f_out)
will change by using same(common) set of  recommended P, M, S (, K),
and the new set of  output rates(f_out) may not be the _required_ set
of target rates.
So we need different set of P, M, S (,K) values for different f_in.

Table should contain set of P, M, S (,K) values for the _required_
target(f_out) rates
for a particular input(f_in) rate.

We already asked hardware engineer about PMS values for PLL,
and we got a table containing recommended  P, M ,S values for a given
f_in(24 MHz)
and required f_out rates.

Please let me know, why you think we are specific to current cases only ?
