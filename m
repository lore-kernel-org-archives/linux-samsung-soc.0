Yes correct, the MCT is designed for the power consumption related

At this moment, we can use the ARM arch timers as clocksource so I think
no performance degradation (some latency?) with using the CP15 access for
the gettimeofday() and friends

Current Exynos SoCs including ARMv8 architecture based have no hardware
something which means 'not working right'

It is depending on system level design architecture. If we don't need to
support some power mode such as cluster power down, we can use arch timers
without the MCT but actual product needed to support it for power consumption.

Let me add some comments.
According to the ARM architecture design, the ARM arch timers require toggle
from outside of the core as timer source and we're using the MCT for it. And
we can use the ARM arch timers as clocksource not the MCT on current Exynos.
