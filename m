That is not a problem.
But I think using list_for_each_entry() is not a problem likewise.

Some driver needs enabling sysmmu to be counted due to its complex structure.
It can be also removed by the driver with an extra effort
but the reality is important.
Device driver is not only for the scholarship but also for the real use.

I told that System MMU driver must be probed earlier.
That's why exynos_iommu_init() is called by subsys_initcall level.
I also noticed that it must be promoted to arch_initcall for some driver.

archdata.iommu has a pointer to sysmmu descriptor for a very short time
during booting time to build complete data structure to handle System MMU.
It is it also a matter?

Anyway, this style of initialization just maintained to make the driver work
with the old design. It is changed with the following patches.
