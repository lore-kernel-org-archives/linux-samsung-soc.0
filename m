I see, thanks for the explanation. I asked because I noticed that the
gpio-restart handler default priority was 129 and I didn't find other
restart handler used for this board with a prio > 129 so at least in
mainline, the priority 200 should not be necessary.

But now I see that it was indeed 128 but was bumped to 129 in commit:

bcd56fe1aa97 ("power: reset: gpio-restart: increase priority slightly")

which explains why the priority 200 was in the veyron DTS even when is
not needed anymore after that commit.

Agreed about bumping the prio for the rockchip specific restart handler.
