Wait, all the set_bit and clear_bit should be even simpler:
	-set_bit(HASH_FLAGS_DMA_READY, &dev->hash_flags);
	+set_bit(HASH_FLAGS_DMA_READY, dev->hash_flags);
This looks actually better..

You mean 32.

Actually not, I do not insist. Just for me it makes the code simpler
(lack of "&" operand) and more robust as you explicitly declare number
of used bits (instead of assumption that your data type on given
compiler matches the amount of flags). Both arguments are not that
important.

Right, good point! The HASH_FLAGS_BUSY bit is cleared only in
s5p_hash_finish_req() which will be executed only if the bit was set
(checked with test_bits()). This should be then put next to the sentence
"atomics are not needed here".

In SMP code, one should not expect too much of order. :)
For sections not guarded by barriers (thus also locks) compiler can
re-order a lot. CPU can re-order even more. Although these
test_bit() and clear_bit() are atomic operations but they do not provide
barriers so they can be re-ordered.

Yes, but on the other hand writing the HASH_FLAGS_BUSY bit in
s5p_hash_finish_req() is not protected anyhow and it will be called on
different CPU in different thread (through tasklet). Although
s5p_hash_finish_req() is called only after checking the bits... but it
is I think unusual pattern (in s5p_hash_tasklet_cb()):
 - test_bit(hash_flags)
 - non-atomic write to hash_flags
 - test_bit(hash_flags)
