Okay, I got it, no node for pwrseq but parse device properties. In case
of reset-gpios it seems quite obvious but also actively used:
$ git grep reset-gpios arch/arm/boot/dts | wc -l
142

Definitely pwrseq shouldn't add itself to all of these devices.

My questions would be then:
1. An additional pwrseq compatible for device is acceptable?
2. How would you name the regulator? We shouldn't toggle off/on every
regulator but probably only some specific ones.

Yes, I left it for next iteration because it would require much more
changes in USB core. As for now, these bindings are useless for USB
devices which are not yet enumerated (because power sequence has to be
done on them). Making use of these bindings would be a next step... Just
let me do it one step a time.
