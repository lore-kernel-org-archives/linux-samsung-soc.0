>=20

I agree with you that it is better if we make it tristate. So, on my
side, I have no concerns changing it to tristate.

However, the exynos5440 cpufreq driver does not depend on of thermal as
of today, and therefore, I did not touch this driver for this matter.
Meaning, if it is not causing troubles, no need to mess with it.

But I can add this change. No issues, on my side.

Indeed.

I will repost this patch with the minor amendments. Now, we only need
an ack from cpufreq folks.
