Ah, I see, that makes sense.

We definitely need a top-level .dts file for each board that is different
in a nondiscoverable way then.

If the mmc settings and possibly some other nodes (to be added later)
are common across them, those can be in a board specific .dtsi file.

For the memory node, I would actually expect that to be filled by
the boot loader, so we could leave it out entirely. The same applies
to the command line: the parts that are in there at the moment (
"console=ttySAC2,115200n8 root=/dev/ram0 ramdisk=16384 initrd=0x42000000,16M")
clearly don't belong into a generic dts file and none of them should be
set that way.

For the initial version, that would mean that the file comes down to having
as its only contents

/dts-v1/;
#include <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>
#include "exynos7123.dtsi"
#include "exynos7-espresso.dtsi" // for the mmc nodes

/ {
       model = "Samsung ESPRESSO board based on EXYNOS7123";
       compatible = "samsung,espresso", "samsung,exynos7123", "samsung,exynos7";
};

One more thing I just noticed is the GPL statement in the dts files.
Can we please change that to a permissive license in order to allow
including it in non-GPL boot loaders and operating systems?

Dual GPL+MIT or GPL+BSD would make most sense here.
