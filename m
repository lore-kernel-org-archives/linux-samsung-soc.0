The revisions were pretty quick
v1 to v2 : Updated DT Documentation for the change
v2 to v3 : use spi->cs_gpio in the driver
v3 to v4 : use gpio_is_valid() instead of using sdd->cs_gpio (local variable,
              also remove sdd->cs_gpio)
v4 to v5 : Added Acked-by and Revewied-by from Javier and Rob Herring

Major discussion in this thread was about keeping the old DT bindings
to support legacy or move on with the new bindings.

Tomasz Figa, Javier Martinez Canillas, Doug Anderson and
Rob Herring agreed with the latter.

Kindly review and let us know your comments.

Thanks
