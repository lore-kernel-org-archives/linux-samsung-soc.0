compatible should be just "usb-connector"

Type should be a property

type: type of usb connector "A", "B", "AB", "C"
AB is for dual-role connectors.

micro super-speed and high-speed connectors are different. How do you differentiate that?

Why do you need label? We can't maintain consistency as people will put creative names there.
Device/bus driver could generate a valid label.

type is misleading. Type is usually A/B/C. It should be size here instead.

size: size of the connector if not standard size. "mini", "micro"

If not specified it is treated as standard sized connector.
e.g. for Type-C there is no mini/micro. so size doesn't have to be specificed

What about Type-C connector?

The label is not consistent with the earlier example.
