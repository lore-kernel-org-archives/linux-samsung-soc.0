That is, unfortunately, correct.

There is a way around this, but people aren't going to like it.  That
is - we move it to the suspend and resume paths anyway.

In the resume path, we read the register, compare it with the value
which we would update it to, and if it's identical, we avoid the write.

This gets secure-mode platforms working.

For non-secure mode platforms, we have to require them to insert some
assembly code into the early resume path which calls their secure
monitor to restore these registers before continuing on to cpu_resume,
thereby ensuring that the CPU specific code sees that the value in the
register is identical with the saved value, and omitting the write.

This isn't really a new principle - we already have this requirement
for non-secure mode platforms when they're booting a kernel with
various errata enabled.

I can't see any other alternative which satisfies everyone (by
everyone, I'm including the requirements from the hardware folk who
expect these registers to be static once the MMU is enabled.)
