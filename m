I admit, I was too vague while stating this. Looking at the big
picture you are obviously right.

I should have referred to those SOCs/buses/drivers that I am working/looking at.

I don't think I have stated anything that isn't in agreement with the above?

While I am struggling in making my points clearer, it seems like we
look a bit differently upon how runtime PM are being deployed.

For those drivers I am working on, it's common that these handles
runtime PM resources, like for example clocks. The clocks needs to be
enabled for the driver to handle I/O, but those may also be gated at
request inactivity to save power. That means, the clocks may be
considered as both functional clocks and runtime PM resources.

Therefore, the driver must enable its clocks during ->probe() and
without relying on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to be set. Similar to what you
stated for the buses above.

To also cope with the scenario where CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is set, drivers
must update the device's runtime PM status using
pm_runtime_set_active(), to synchronize the state with the runtime PM
core. Otherwise we will get clock unbalance issues while
gating/ungating the clocks from the runtime PM callbacks.

The AMBA bus and some of its drivers a good example of how this has
been implemented:
driver/amba/bus.c
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c
drivers/spi/spi-pl022.c

This conclusion I have made from this is:
- Using pm_runtime_get_sync() during the ->probe() path to explicitly
power up a PM domain, is not suitable as the _common_ solution to
solve the race condition. It certainly may work for some scenarios,
but not for those I am looking at.

For PM domains that are initialized in powered off state, we can't
rely on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME and thus not on pm_runtime_get_sync() to
power on these PM domains. We need a different mechanism, which is
suggested in this v3 patchset.

The requirement of being able to initialize PM domains in powered off
state, was raised during review of v2 of this patchset. I do realize
that's not easy for you to keep track and remember of all discussions.
I apologize for not providing this as the topmost important argument
to why pm_runtime_get_sync() can't be used, in my reply to Kevin.

Typically drivers expects the bus/subsystem level code to power on
their resources which is needed for it to succeed probing/handling
I/O. I believe this is also in agreement to what you stated earlier
above.

This patchset adopts the behaviour above, for those buses which may
hold devices belonging to PM domains.

That said, maybe the wording of "race conditions" should have been
better picked to better describe the issue I am trying to solve.
