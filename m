>  Hello! So what's up? I see SROM driver suddenly removed from everywhere and no single word about it. What is the status?

What do you mean by everywhere? That sounds a little bit drastic... I
did not apply it before at the first place... so if you have in mind
only Kukjin's tree (and linux-next as a result) then indeed - Pankaj's
patches were not accepted during 4.3 merge window, remained in
Kukjin's tree in a separate branch and finally were not included in
current 'for-next' after rebasing over 4.4-rc1 (because they stayed in
separate branch).

As for the current status I reviewed all the patches but, since
Pankaj's work is present in Kukjin's branch, I won't duplicate the
work.

The question is then to Kukjin - what is your plan? Two more patchsets
are depending on it:
1. Pavel's extension of SROM,
2. Pankaj's movement of PM to drivers/soc.

What do you need to apply them?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
