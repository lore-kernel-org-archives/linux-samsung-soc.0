Please consider an example:

normal-freqs: 1400000, 1200000, 1000000, 800000, 600000, 400000, 200000
[1]
boost-freqs: 1700000, 1600000, 1500000. [2]

All those freqs shall be represented as OPPs freq and voltage tuple.

Best would be to specify all the boost-freqs as:
boost-freqs = <1700000 1600000 1500000> to be prepared for future
quirks or problems (or special cases which might show up latter).
If anybody can foresee any potential threads - like platform on which
boost freqs are 1700000 and 1500000, but not 1600000, then please share
this information.

However, I think that it would be also acceptable to specify only:
boost-freq = <1500000> and mark all freqs greater or equal to it as
CPUFREQ_BOOST_FREQ.

If there aren't any potential problems, then I think the second option
would be a good solution (we would have only one BOOST attribute stored
at CPUs DTS node).
