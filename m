Well, if it only was so simple. :)

[ Unfortunately, they have higher priority tasks so this is unlikely to get
  fixed in the foreseeable future. ]

Problems with AFTR are also not limited to our U-Boot problem (i.e. issue
with Hypervisor enabled on EXYNOS5 or problem with CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL=y
compiled kernels) so it would be nice to have a way to disable it without
the need for recompiling the kernel.

Limiting maximum allowed cpuidle state is also useful for testing purposes
(this is not limited to EXYNOS driver but a generally useful thing).
