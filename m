The term boost and over-clocking have been described in the bindings
document as being the same. Since the term over-clocking refers to
running a CPU beyond normal operating frequencies, I tend to agree
with Sudeep that it is not intuitive if a normal operating frequency
is greater than a boost mode frequency.

Otherwise, when userspace does "echo 1 >
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost", what is it supposed to mean. I
think the original intent of boost mode patches was to allow CPU to
operate at frequencies greater than the normal operating frequencies.

Lukasz, how would you want this to be handled?

Thanks,
Thomas.
