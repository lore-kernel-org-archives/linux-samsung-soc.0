Cool. Only this morning I was thinking about what would be needed in v4l2
to be y2038 safe, and here it is!

I suspect that quite a few apps use assign the timestamp to another timeval
struct. A quick grep in v4l-utils (which we maintain) shows at least two of
those assignments. Ditto for xawtv3.

So I don't think v4l2_timeval is an option as it would break userspace too badly.

An alternative to supporting a 64-bit timeval for 32-bit userspace is to make a
new y2038-aware struct and a new set of ioctls and use this opportunity to clean
up and extend the v4l2_buffer struct.

So any 32-bit app that needs to be y2038 compliant would just use the new
struct and ioctls.

But this is something to discuss among the v4l2 developers.
