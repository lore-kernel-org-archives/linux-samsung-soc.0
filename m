Nishanth, though I am not convinced that it should be list, since you have a
valid point that this should not prevent in having this feature, I am fine with
the list.

If that's the case then why should it be included in the list of OPPs.
I know Nishanth had a valid point in other thread previously(like including
SoC.dtsi having OPPs in platform files), but that's different problem.

Yes I prefer this to keep it simple and as per the definition of overclocking
or turbo boost in hardware terms if possible.

Just another thought, not sure how much this is true for real platforms, sharing
it anyway. IIUC these boost frequencies have certain constraints like thermal
and can't be sustained all the processors for long time.

So does it make sense to specify normal max frequency instead of boost-frequency
which by definition would be: "The maximum frequency that all processors are can
sustain simultaneously without any thermal constraints".
Ignore this if this is not the definition of boost on real platforms.
