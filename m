Yes, I think your refined approach works and is better than my
original patch, thanks a lot for giving it more thought!

I believe this one also has to be tristate, for the same reason.

This change is ok, but not needed, because the three extra symbols are still
bool. I would leave that change out, but I also don't mind it.

With the change to make ARM_EXYNOS5440_CPUFREQ tristate:
