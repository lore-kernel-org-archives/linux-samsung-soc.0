Unfortunately I'm unlikely to find time to do it myself in nearest future, so 
feel free to do it. Thanks.

Keep in mind, however, that this patch was a dependency of

[PATCH 0/6] Samsung watchdog support clean-up
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/18736/focus=18951

so I would like to keep this series applicable.
