Yes, that was a typo. I will fix it.

In the Exynos4412 user manual that I referred, the SelClk_Drv and
SelClk_Sample bit fields of the CLKSEL register are 2 bits wide. Could
you please confirm that these two bit-fields are infact 3 bits wide?

Exynos4 does not have the additional clock divisor, as in Exynos5250.
Could you please explain why the bus_hz clock should be divided in
Exynos4?

Yes, you had mentioned this previously. But these are only default
values. In case, a board cannot work with these default values, the
board's dtsi file should provide the correct values by using these
bindings. What is your opinion on this, please let me know.

Thanks for your time reviewing this patch series.
