This patch appears to be conceptually wrong.  Many of these properties
are merely static capabilities of each individual device which the
driver should already have knowledge of, and be setting the capability
bits appropriately on its own.

So, you /don't/ want to simply create a 1:1 list between the current
linux capability bits (which are subject to change) and the device
tree properties (which ideally must not be changed after they are
defined).

What you need to do is figure out which properties are required to
describe the hardware about things that the driver wouldn't already
know.  For example, 'polling' is something the driver would already
know because it is an aspect of the specific device, but
'nonremovable' is a physical characteristic of some boards.  'disable'
and the speed timings are also something I would expect the driver to
know about and what to set itself.

So, only define properties for things that the device-specific driver
cannot know for itself; or are the sort of parameters that a
multi-device driver is already using for differentiation (ie. appears
in pdata instead of directly set by the driver).  You should be able
to justify the need for each property that gets defined.
