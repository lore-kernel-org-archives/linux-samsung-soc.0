I don't think we should add other nodes to /cpus besides cpu nodes.

The presence of architected timers is defined by the cpu being a
Cortex-A15. So you don't really need a timer node at all. All that is
really needed is the interrupt. You could add interrupts property
directly to each cpu node. The location of PMU nodes has come up
recently as well, and the PMU interrupt could be added as well.

Whether we should change the binding at this point is questionable.
Normally, we wouldn't want to do that, but as this is all pretty new it
may be okay to make an exception here. However, I don't see anything
that is fundamentally broken with the current binding. Multi-cluster
could introduce some issues.

Except things done before documentation was enforced.
