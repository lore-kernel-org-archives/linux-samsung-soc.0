Hi Abhilash,

The patch itself seems fine, but I wonder if those config options aren't
really just leftovers from the past and couldn't be completely removed.

The only place where this symbol is used is below.

With this symbol the situation isn't that easy, but still should be
manageable.

Looking at the serial-samsung driver, all occurrences of
CONFIG_SERIAL_SAMSUNG_UARTS could be simply replaced with a locally
defined number equal to the maximum value - in this case 4.

There are also two places in arch/arm where this symbol is used:

1) In arch/arm/mach-s3c64xx/irq-pm.c it's used as the number of serial
ports which need suspend/resume handling. Since on s3c64xx the number is
always 4, it can be simply defined locally as a constant.

2) In arch/arm/plat-samsung/init.c it is used to determine size of a
static array of UART ports and to check whether the UART driver is
enabled. In former case I believe it should be safe to hardcode it to 4
as well, in latter CONFIG_SERIAL_SAMSUNG can be used.

Best regards,
Tomasz
