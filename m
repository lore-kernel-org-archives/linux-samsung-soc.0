I'm perfectly aware that s3c-hsotg is just for UDC functionality. I 
just wanted to ask if this driver can replace s3c-hsotg.c driver 
completely?

You can always create so called variants of the driver that exports 
different functionality depending on the platform data the driver has
been bound to. Usually it is used to distinguish different models of 
the hardware that has a lot in common. For example please refer to 
driver/media/video/s5p-fimc/fimc-core.c and fimc_driver_ids array in
the bottom of the code.

You got me wrong. I wanted to ask if one needs to tweak in mass storage
driver to get it working with DWC OTG driver? I'm asking because I've
already seen a lot of scary code on some public Android trees, where mass
storage was hacked to workaround bugs (or flaws) in the OTG driver.

Have you tried your DWC OTG driver with some more demanding gadget
drivers? One of such is g_multi which exports 3 usb functions (RNDIS,
ACM serial and Mass Storage) in a composite device.
