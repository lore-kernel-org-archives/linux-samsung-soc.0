Hi Guenter/Lukasz,

Earlier I send v2 version of the patch spiking this one.

Markus Riechl came back to me with below mail.
So This patch confirms fixes the bug.

I will send v3 version of the patch. Earlier I was in delima about the =
bug.

Hi Anand,

I tested your patch.

After booting the fan is spinning despite only 44=B0C.

/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/curstate is 0.
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon4/pwm1 is 0

when I echo 1 > cur_state and then echo 0 > cur_state again,
the fan switches to off and behaves as expected.

It looks like there is a bug in initializing the pwm output
immediately after booting.

Best Regards,
