It would not be the same for all buses.  Each bus will have its own way 
of recognizing whether or not a driver has been probed (i.e., by 
checking some field in the bus-specific part of the device structure).

Yes.  But the bus has to issue pm_runtime_enable() before probing the 
driver, because the driver will expect runtime PM to work properly 
while its probe routine runs.  For example, the probe routine might 
want to leave the device in a runtime-suspended state.  It can't do 
that if the device isn't enabled for runtime PM.
