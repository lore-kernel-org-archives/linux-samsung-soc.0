I've checked clk_core_is_enabled() is only used for implementing disabling
of unused clock trees or implementing ->is_enabled() callback, which is used
for the same purpose, so it should be safe to use standard 
pm_runtime_get/put
there.

There should be no other usecases for ->is_enabled() method, as it itself is
not really race prone, as other caller might enable/disable given clock in
meantime.

I will remove clk_pm_runtime_suspended() usage then.

Right.
