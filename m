This does not sound like anything bus-specific. Can we move powering on
the domain before probing into the driver core, similarly to the default
pin selection by pinctrl? I do not see why we want to have every
individual bus to implement this. I guess right now we can't because we
assign the domain to device in individual bus's probe function, but I do
not think this is proper place for that either: bus and pm domain are
orthogonal concepts IMO.

I think this only true for buses that support discovery.
