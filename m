CC'ing Doug and Andrew who have also worked on ASV.

I tested these patches on a 5250 Chromebook after modifying the
cpufreq code and a few other changes for booting the board. The driver
is retrieving the ASV fused group correctly. The behavior on an
unfused SMDK5250 is also fine.
I have a few minor comments on the patches.

Thanks
Abhilash
