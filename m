I'd be really happy if you gave me such opinions before pull request.

Anyway, below is my comments.

Ok, now I understood. Your comment was not enough to me.

First of all, if I see component codes correctly then it seems your
misunderstanding. See the below comments,

Are you sure?

exynos_drm_add_components() will try to attach components *added to
component_lists. And these components will be added by only
corresponding sub drivers to the component_lists and
master->components.

So in this case, if users disabled HDMI support then a commponent
object for HDMI sub driver doesn't exists in the component_lists and
master->components. This means that a component object for HDMI sub
driver *cannot be attached to master object*.

As a result, component_bind_add() will ignor component_bind call for
HDMI sub driver so HDMI driver will not be bounded. The only
components added by sub drivers will be bound, component->ops->bind().

For more understanding, it seems like you need to look into below codes,

static int exynos_drm_add_components(...)
{
        ...
        for (i == 0;; i++) {
                ...
                node = of_parse_phandle(np, "ports", i);
                ...
                ret = component_master_add_child(m, compare_of, node);
                ...
        }
}


And below codes,

int component_master_add_child(...)
{
        list_for_each_entry(c, &component_list, node) {
                if (c->master)
                        continue;

                if (compare(...)) {
                         component_attach_master(master, c);
                         ...
                }
        }
}

And below codes,

static void component_attach_master(master, c)
{
        c->master = master;
        list_add_tail(&c->master_node, &master->comonents);
}


As you can see above, the only components added to component_list can
be attached to master. And the important thing is that components can
be added by sub drivers to the component_list.

And below codes that actually tries to bind each sub drivers,

int component_bind_add(...)
{
        ....
        list_for_each_entry(c, &master->components, master_node) {
                   ret = component_bind(c, master, data);
                   ...
        }
        ...
}

The hdmi driver users disabled doesn't exist to master->components list.
How Exynos DRM cannot be initialized?

Of course, there may be my missing point, but I think I see them
correctly. Anyway I will test them tomorrow.

Thanks,
