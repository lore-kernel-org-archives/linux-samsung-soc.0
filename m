Indeed. One ideal solution would be to make all the board code into
a module, yet since some of the code should be executed really
early and need to stay as built-in, looks like we need a way to
separate these two parts.

That's true, however, I think the size will become a bit more significa=
nt
if more and more board code is compiled into a single kernel.
