Hi,

How about something along the lines of:

"This patch adds dts entries for the SYSMMU devices found on Exynos4
and Exynos5 SoC series and the SYSMMU binding documentation."

instead of this empty changelog ?

The interrupt specifier depends on the interrupt controller (interrupt-parent). 
So it might not always be a "tuple of numbers". It's probably better to say,
e.g.:

- interrupts: Should contain the SYSMMU controller interrupt.

You could replace "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock" with "../clock"

Isn't it required always when an SoC support Power Domains and the SYSMMU
belongs to a power domain ? Perhaps something like:

- samsung,power-domain: Required if the System MMU belongs to a Power Domain.

would be more appropriate ?

You could omit all the above properties, perhaps just leaving
'compatible' property, simply replacing them with:
		...

since the only relevant property hers is 'iommu' ? Just a suggestion
though.

Shouldn't this be:

		iommu = <&sysmmu_gsc0>;
? 
It also probably makes sense to put the SYMMU device node above 
the master device node.

How about putting this node as last one in this example ?

Do you really need 'interrupt-names' property, when there is only
one interrupt in each node. Isn't it just a leftover from previous
iterations ? I can't see it mentioned in the binding documentation.
