Hi Shuah Khan,

Like Bartlomiej mentioned below, it is completely fair to call
clk_prepare_enable() with NULL clocks. That's how most of the
optional clocks are handled in the kernel. So, i don't think
there's any need of adding an additional check for the 
'exynos->susp_clk'.

The 'exynos->clk' is the main IP clock that is mandatory, and hence
the probe fails in case that is not present.

Thanks for adding me to the thread.

You are right. The exynos7 device tree patches could not make it to
upstream for some reasons. I think there are few guys looking at USB
for Exynos.
If there's something needed on Exynos7 USB side, i have added
Pankaj Dubey <pankaj.dubey@samsung.com> to this thread.

Hi Pankaj,
I am adding you to please help us with any future requirements
for exynos USB in the upstream.
Thanks!
