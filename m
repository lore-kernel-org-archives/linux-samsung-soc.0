Odroid boards uses multi stage bootloaders. The very first stage is in 
SoC ROM.
That code loads next stages (called bl1, bl2, tz) from either eMMC or SD 
card
(depending on jumper configuration or some card detect pins). This ROM 
code is
very simple and assumes that the mmc card has been reset to the default
configuration. However, eMMC card is not being reset by the board 
'reboot' logic.
Instead the nreset line from emmc card is connected to gpio line of SoC. 
Thus to
perform full system reboot procedure, before triggering reboot inside 
the SoC,
one need to manually toggle nreset line of this emmc card to 'zero' for 
a while.
Only then the card is put back to the default state, so ROM code is able 
to read
bootloaders from it.

My patch adds code for managing gpio line connected to nreset signal of 
emmc card.
It registers reset handler, which is being triggered from Linux reboot 
code. This
handler toggles such gpio line before the final reboot is triggered. My 
patch also
provides a function for registering as a mmc host hw_reset callback, so 
it can be
used to reset mmc card before initializing it with kernel driver (this 
is already
implemented), which also might help to get it working if broken 
bootloader left
the emmc card in some unknown/broken state (already observed such issue, 
but it
has been fixed finally by patching bootloader).

I didn't consider mmc-pwrseq yet. For me it looked straightforward to 
implement
it just like card detect or write-protection gpio pins. I already 
noticed that
there is code for some mmc host driver, which perform mmc hardware 
reset. If you
think that extending pwrseq is the better approach, I will try to update my
patches. This will add reboot handler to mmc-pwrseq then. The only 
question is
weather to use it always when mmc-pwrseq has been enabled or only if some
additional property like 'reset-on-reboot' has been provided.
