Here's what I get on my X2.

Output stops there, I don't see any more output with respect to hung
tasks (even though hung task detection is on and I've waited for like 10
minutes).

Anyway, I looks like that smsc95xx_unbind() is never called, and hence
the check_carrier() delayed work queue isn't cancelled.

However I'm not convinced that this is the real problem. I have manually
triggered the unbind before shutdown, and while the error message from
the smsc95xx driver have disappeared, the other messages are still produced.

My guess is that we are seeing these messages because reboot is not
working, and not the other way round.
