Yes, one of the reasons for these changes is to remove the gpio->regaddr
mappings we've been keeping around for a while. Given the new gpiolib code
it makes sense to base all the platform specific calls off the same numbering
scheme and even use the same data structures.

I'll post a series from the following, possibly later today.
