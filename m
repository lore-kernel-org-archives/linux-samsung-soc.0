First of all, I think that clock dependency shuold be resolved with setting
the parent of clock descriptor of fimc-lite  to the clock descriptor of
fimc-is.
If you are concerning about power management, it is simply resolved with
putting fimc-lite to the power domain of fimc-is.
The above tree will be changed like below after probing System MMU:
sysmmu-fimc-is
            I
     fimc-is

sysmmu-fimc-lite0
              I
      fimc-lite0

sysmmu-fimc-lite1
             I
       fimc-lite1

Thank you for good idea. However mmuname is an array of strings, actually.
Anyway I agree with your opinion that 'mmuname' is not proper property of a
device node. I will remove it and substitute it with base register address
of a System MMU.

OK. I will trying to find another expression easy to understand.  Do you
have any suggestion?

If you are concerning about power management, it is simply resolved with pu=

The above tree will be changed like below after probing System MMU:<br>

&gt; +* Samsung Exynos System MMU<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Samsung&#39;s Exynos architecture includes System MMU that enables sc=
attered<br>
&gt; +physical chunks to be visible as a contiguous region to DMA-capabile =
peripheral<br>
&gt; +devices like MFC, FIMC, FIMD, GScaler, FIMC-IS and so forth.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +System MMU is a sort of IOMMU and support identical translation table=
 format to<br>
&gt; +ARMv7 translation tables with minimum set of page properties includin=
g access<br>
&gt; +permissions, shareability and security protection. In addition System=
 MMU has<br>
&gt; +another capabilities like L2 TLB or block-fetch buffers to minimize t=
ranslation<br>
&gt; +latency<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Each System MMU is included in the H/W block of a peripheral device. =
Thus, it is<br>
&gt; +important to specify that a System MMU is dedicated to which peripher=
al device<br>
&gt; +before using System MMU. System initialization must specify the relat=
ionships<br>
&gt; +between a System MMU and a peripheral device that owns the System MMU=
.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Some device drivers may control several peripheral devices with a sin=
gle device<br>
&gt; +descriptor like MFC. Since handling a System MMU with IOMMU API requi=
res a<br>
&gt; +device descriptor that needs the System MMU, it is best to combine th=
e System<br>
&gt; +MMUs of the peripheral devices and control them with a single System =
MMU device<br>
&gt; +descriptor. If it is unable to combine them into a single device desc=
riptor,<br>
&gt; +they can be linked with each other by the means of device.parent rela=
tionship.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Required properties:<br>
&gt; +- compatible: Should be &quot;samsung,exynos-sysmmu&quot;.<br>
&gt; +- reg: Tuples of base address and size of System MMU registers. The n=
umber of<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 tuples can be more than one if two or more Syst=
em MMUs are controlled<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 by a single device descriptor.<br>
&gt; +- interrupt-parent: The phandle of the interrupt controller of System=
 MMU<br>
&gt; +- interrupts: Tuples of numbers that indicates the interrupt source. =
The<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0number of elements i=
n the tuple is dependent upon<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 &#39;interrupt-parent&#39;=
 property. The number of tuples in this property<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 must be the same with &#39=
;reg&#39; property.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Optional properties:<br>
&gt; +- mmuname: Strings of the name of System MMU for debugging purpose. T=
he number<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0of strings must be the same with t=
he number of tuples in &#39;reg&#39;<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0property.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As commented on previous patch, this isn&#39;t something that belongs =
here.<br>
&gt; But for debugging you could probably retrieve this from the node name =
?</p>
<p>Thank you for good idea. However mmuname is an array of strings, actuall=
y. Anyway I agree with your opinion that &#39;mmuname&#39; is not proper pr=
operty of a device node. I will remove it and substitute it with base regis=
ter address of a System MMU.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; +- mmu-master: phandle to the device node that owns System MMU. Only t=
he device<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0that is specified whith this prope=
rty can control System MMU with<br>
&gt; + =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0IOMMU API.<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +Examples:<br>
&gt; +<br>
&gt; +MFC has 2 System MMUs for each port that MFC is attached. Thus it see=

OK. I will trying to find another expression easy to understand.=C2=A0 Do y=
