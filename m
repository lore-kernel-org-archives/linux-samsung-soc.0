Hi Brian,

Thank you for debugging, and fell sorry for the delay reply

Yeah, I have saw this failed on some chromebook too, but finally it transmit
successfully, so I guess this maybe caused by hardware different.

I have tested that driver do receive the hpd interrupt when i 
plugged/unplugged the
eDP screen, and at that time driver would read the HPD connected status 
rightly.

But I haven't fingered out why driver couldn't get the right HPD status 
in the early time,
need debug more...

Thanks, I have noticed it too, also I try to expand the hotplug timeout, 
but Jingoo
suggested not to do that, cause it would bring external delay on Exynos 
platform.

Besides from what Heiko reply, expand this delay time wouldn't give any help
on those Jaq no display case, delay the panel power up time would be the 
right
way to fix that, so maybe no need to expand the hotpulg timeout.

- Thanks
