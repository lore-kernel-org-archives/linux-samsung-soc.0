Not very useful indeed.

Yes, but like I said in a previous email the fact that are different doesn't
necessarily mean that they will be helpful for debugging purposes.

IIRC the OF core uses the device node unit address and node name to create
the platform device names so you will have something like 10044000.power-domain.

Same if using the node full_name since it will /power-domain@10044000. In both
cases the DTS should have to be checked to know which power domain really is
unless someone knows by heart the power domains addresses.

But if using generic names for the power domains as suggested by ePAPR is so
important then we should change all the other Exynos DTS files which don't do.
