Hi Kamil,

Thank you for trusting me. :-)
I just asked my validation engineer about 5250 USB PHY.
As I know, she has the best knowledge about Samsung SoC USB hardware.
She said that there are 2 PHY controllers such as USB 2.0 PHY, USB 3.0 PHY.

  1) USB2.0 PHY: USB2.0 HOST, USB2.0 Device
  2) USB3.0 PHY: USB3.0 DRD (3.0 HOST & 3.0 Device)

According to her, USB3.0 PHY can support both 3.0 Host and 3.0 Device.
Thank you.

Best regards,
