Please have a comment about what each /memreserve/ is intended to
protect.

If it depends on each particular model then it doesn't belong in the
shared dtsi, and each dts should have the /memreserve/ for that
platform.

Why would the hypervisor or secure OS memory ever be accessible to the
kernel such that it would require a memreserve? That sounds
fundamentally broken.

I was under the impression that if using UEFI we can identify and
reserve the UEFI services by walking to UEFI memory map. If we don't use
them, they don't need to be protected. As such, I don't see why they
need a memreserve for them.

Ok.

Yes please. You presumably don't have "just 'ARMv8 core'", but rather a
specific ARMv8 implementation.

While it's probably ok to have "arm,cortex-a15-gic" in the compatible
list, it would be good to also have a more specific string, so we can
identify the GIC implementation precisely in future (in case we need to
perform any workarounds, or there's some kind of optimisation we could
perform for some implementations).

Each CPU microarchitecture has different PMU events and quirks. While
the CPU PMU might be compatible with ARMv8's PMUv3, it will also have
implementation-specific events, and may have quirks we need to work
around in future.

As with 32-bit, we'd expect these to be of the form
"${implementor},${cpu}-pmu".

Ok.

So you'll add these?

Looking at ePAPR, the recommended format is "manufacturer,model", and
the string is intended to identify a particular implementation. It is
not intended to give details about the implementation that can be
derived from the name.

We seem to have ignored the format (and to some degree purpose) of the
model property so far, but I don't see any reason to fill it with
unnecessary information.

Thanks,
Mark.
