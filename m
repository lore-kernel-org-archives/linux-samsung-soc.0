There are 3 regulators with equal constraints:

/regulator@0: constraints->min_uV = 3300000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000
/regulator@2: constraints->min_uV = 3300000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000
/regulator@4: constraints->min_uV = 3300000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000

and 3 with different constraints:

/regulator@1: constraints->min_uV = 1800000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000
/regulator@3: constraints->min_uV = 1800000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000
/regulator@5: constraints->min_uV = 1800000, constraints->max_uV = 3300000

For the first SDHI channel, these come from:

        vcc_sdhi0: regulator@0 {
                compatible = "regulator-fixed";

                regulator-name = "SDHI0 Vcc";
                regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
                regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;

                gpio = <&gpio7 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                enable-active-high;
        };

        vccq_sdhi0: regulator@1 {
                compatible = "regulator-gpio";

                regulator-name = "SDHI0 VccQ";
                regulator-min-microvolt = <1800000>;
                regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;

                gpios = <&gpio2 12 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                gpios-states = <1>;
                states = <3300000 1
                          1800000 0>;
        };

        &sdhi0 {
                pinctrl-0 = <&sdhi0_pins>;
                pinctrl-names = "default";

                vmmc-supply = <&vcc_sdhi0>;
                vqmmc-supply = <&vccq_sdhi0>;
                cd-gpios = <&gpio6 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
                wp-gpios = <&gpio6 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
                status = "okay";
        };

giving:

        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: GPIO lookup for consumer cd
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: using device tree for GPIO lookup
        of_get_named_gpiod_flags: parsed 'cd-gpios' property of node
'/sd@ee100000[0]' - status (0)
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: Got CD GPIO
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: GPIO lookup for consumer wp
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: using device tree for GPIO lookup
        of_get_named_gpiod_flags: parsed 'wp-gpios' property of node
'/sd@ee100000[0]' - status (0)
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: Got WP GPIO
======> sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: could not set regulator OCR (-22)
        gpio_rcar e6055400.gpio: sense irq = 6, type = 3
        sh_mobile_sdhi ee100000.sd: mmc0 base at 0xee100000 clock rate 97 MHz

The line marked with the arrow is introduced by the changed check, and looks
to be the origin of the failure.

Later, the "unbalanced disables for SDHI0 VccQ" warning is triggered.
Probably the error path always disables the second regulator, even if it was
never enabled due an the earlier failure.
