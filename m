As per Arnd's comment on your RFC patch he mentioned -
"I believe the part you are missing is that with the approach I suggested,
there would be no registration function at all."

I think he is not in favor of adding such registration function at all. So
do you think
adding such function will really solve the problem?

Further even Lee Jones agreed to Arnd's point of making syscon independent
of device,
but he also mentioned that it can be done in subsequent patch.
  
So in IMHO, your RFC patch can be taken as is, and any further improvement
suggested
by Arnd can be done in subsequent patches,  because as I can see in 3.17-rc1
still
has user of syscon_regmap_lookup_by_pdevname (clps711x.c) so we can't
completely
make it independent of platform_device as of now and also the changes
required
as per Arnd's suggestions requires considerable effort and time.
