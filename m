AFAIR, the PL080 in S3C64xx is a slightly customized variant and requires 
some modifications to the driver. However I'm saying this only based on 
what I remember from the past, as I haven't checked current version of the 
driver yet, so it's possible that it has been modified already.

I believe I will eventually have to take a look at it anyway, as it's a 
necessary step towards S3C64xx DT support.

Best regards,
