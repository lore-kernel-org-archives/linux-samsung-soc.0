Sry, my bad. Rechecked - found 289 occurrences of pm_runtime_enable().
Number of Runtime PM enabled drivers = at about 289 +-10%.
- headers, suspend/resume,..
+ buses like amba and spmi

Right. I worry about Platform bus first of all, because HW PM implementation
(at least for ARM SoCs) can be very different there.

This is just a different view (RFC) on your idea to call pm_runtime_get_sync()
 before dev->driver is initialized
("(b) bypassing the driver callbacks somehow".
  http://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&m=141505768026211&w=2)

- add some flag like dev->is_probing
- in pm_runtime_probe_get_sync() do
  dev->is_probing = true;
  pm_runtime_get_sync();
  dev->is_probing = false;
  
- update 3 places in code pm_generic_runtime_resume, pm_genpd_default_save_state and
  __rpm_get_callback like below (only for .runtime_resume):

+++ b/drivers/base/power/generic_ops.c
@@ -42,6 +42,9 @@ int pm_generic_runtime_resume(struct device *dev)
 {
        const struct dev_pm_ops *pm = dev->driver ? dev->driver->pm : NULL;
        int ret;
+       
+       if (dev->is_probing)
+               pm = NULL;

Then drivers (at least platform drivers) will be able to call
  pm_runtime_enable(dev);
  pm_runtime_probe_get_sync(dev);
at any time they think is right (no problem with parent devices,
Power domain will be enabled, class/type/bus callback will be called,
no need to use pm_runtime_set_active()).
