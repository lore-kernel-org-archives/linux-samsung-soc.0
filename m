OMAP HW doesn't allow "funny" things like overlay being outside the
visible area, i.e. negative position or size larger than the display.
And my guess is that hardware rarely allow things like that, as it would
just complicate the hardware without any gain.

Out-of-display-overlays can of course be emulated by the software. But
I'm not sure if it's good to add the complexity in the driver layer, as
it could as well be handled in the userspace.

Then again, a signed value would be future safer ("just in case"), and
if the driver can just reject values it doesn't want to support, there's
no real harm there either.
