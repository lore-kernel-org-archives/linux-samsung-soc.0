Did you see my comments on the last series you submitted?

As much as possible.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'big overhead', could you elaborate on
that statement.

I personally do not think multiple plat- directories are much of a problem
and much prefer them to some form of heirarchy as you are discussing here
although there are probably merits either way.

No, each driver header carries all the necessary defines for the
version, since if the driver needs updating it is likely the header
file for that driver will need updating too.

For the maps, these are much more chip specific and will probably
be changed to a more specific name to make them easier to find if
they need to be common.

Part of the device change will be to move to a table based system
where there will be less need to have things defined in header
files.

We also want to try and ensure that <plat/xxx.h> xxx.h items are
unique as possible to avoid finding a large number of matches
for xxx.h in the header files and having to work out which one is
being included.

Have a look at the documentation in the pre-release and then make
some comments then (if you need to).
