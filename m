Ah, I didn't understand 'users'  meanings.

Now, clk-exynos4.c driver in mainline don't provide the clocks for PPMU IP. So, I can't add dt node of exynos4_busfreq to exynos4210.dtsi/exynos4x12.dtsi/exynos4210-trats.dts/exynos4412-trats2.dts.

First of all, I will add the ppmu clocks to clk-exynos4.c driver and then modify dts file for exynos4_busfreq as your comment. That which add the ppmu clocks is apart from this patch set.

Thanks for your comment.

Best Regards,
Chanwoo Choi
