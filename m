Please do not forget that there might be some drivers not yet submited
to mainline and mainline should not break them with an assumption that
there are no such drivers.

=46or example, there is an on-going work on an open source OpenGL
implementation for the GPU in S3C6410, known as OpenFIMG. Currently it
uses a little kernel module for low level hardware management
(interrupts, contexts, locking, power management), involving clock
gating and runtime power management, but a DRM driver is planned.
