IMHO the most important part that I believe should be stated in the
documentation is that CPU usually can operate in boost mode for limited
amount of time, which depends on thermal conditions, which makes the
boost operating points separate from normal ones, which can be used at
any time.

It seems reasonable to have boost operating points completely separate
from normal ones, so that a kernel without support for boost mode will
not use them. Also considering my comment above, logically boost
operating points are not considered normal operating points, due to
various constraints that need to be met to use them (i.e. mostly thermal
conditions).

Would it make any difference?

IMHO, as long as the binding is well defined and doesn't cause
significant issues, I don't think there is a reason to redesign it and
add a necessity to support both new and old variants.
