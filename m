I was checking a problem like this:

(1) Start a CTO timer
(2) Start a command
(3) Got CMD_DONE interrupt and cancel the CTO timer
(4) Start a DRTO timer
(5) Start external dma to get the data from fifo
(6) The system bus/DRAM port is idle for a very long time for no
matter what happen.
(7) DRTO timer fires but DTO was set as the card have already
sent all data to the fifo.
(8) Now you patch bails out earlier  and notify the mmc core that this
data transfer was finished successfully.
(9) mmc core propgate the successful state to block layer and maybe
a critical reader in file system will use the data right now but it
falls into trouble due to the incomplete data.


The problem comes from step 6 and setep 7. Quote some bit from dwmmc
databook, V270a, section 7.1,

"While using the external DMA interface for reading from a card, the DTO
interrupt occurs only after all the data is flushed to memory by the DMA
Interface unit. A Busy Clear Interrupt is asserted after the DTO."

So the DTO isn't reliable or perfectly good in practice for that case
that the delay is in external DMA side. That is hard to reproduced but
it was the reason for me to come up with the immature idea of adding
a longer enough and catch-all timer. Or we only set a longer enough
timeout value for CTO and DRTO timer and we could blindly believe the
hardware falls into troube for HW reason and seems that makes the change
simpler. Looking forward to your opinion. :)
