Hi Thomas,

Other than the same question about 400 MHz OPP for Exynos4210, I have
also few more inline.

There are more Exynos5420-based boards supported in mainline. If you do
not have necessary data and/or hardware to fully enable the new driver
on them, you should add responsible people on Cc list, so at least they
know they have one more item on their TODO list. Added them for you.

Where does this latency value comes from? How did you calculate it?

For example, on Exynos4210, for all operating points added by your
patches, the highest PLL locking latency will be 60uS, because the
highest PDIV value would be 6 and PLL lock time is PDIV*240 ticks of 24
MHz reference clock.

Is there no regulator for cpu0?

Do you need to specify this property for every CPU or rather just for
those which have operating points specified?

Best regards,
