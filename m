As much as possible it's nice to touch the main exynos dtsi file and
specific board files in different patches.  Among other things it
makes backporting the patch and resolving merge conflicts easier (if
someone doesn't care about snow they could just pick up the main dtsi,
for instance).

I'm not a total stickler and I'd love to see this land quickly to
avoid conflicts, though...

Itty bitty bitty nit that "bus" sorts alphabetically above "clk".  ;)
Maybe Kukjin would be willing to sort these when he applies?


Thank you for all your hard work on this one.  Things look MUCH MUCH
nicer!  I did a pretty thorough review of your changes and it all
looks good.
