Hi,

Actually during previous discussion I addressed all the issues:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/18/108
but there was no response from your side.

In previous thread you also asked about proper way of using the
DELAYED_RESET_ASSERTION. I tried to obtain additional docs from LSI
but couldn't. In current documentation it was described vaguely so I
looked at vendor source code. The patch IMHO is the best solution.
Additionally it was tested (Chanwoo and Bartlomiej) and fixes the
issue.

As for the soc_is_exynos -> of_machine_is_compatible I will prepare a
follow up to fix this.

Let me know if you have any other comments about it.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
