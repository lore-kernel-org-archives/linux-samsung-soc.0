Ok, I will move them to a new file in the next version.

The reasons for having three different tables are.

1. The PLL frequency table is a list of frequencies which the PLL is
capable of generating. A PLL can be used in two or more SoCs but the
frequencies it can generate does not change from one SoC to the other.
A SoC can further enforce limitations on the list of frequencies that
PLL should be programmed for (due to limitations in the hardware).

2. The core clock is derived from the PLL clock output. The list of
frequencies supported by the core clock need not be same as that of
the PLL table. An example of that is, if the minimum frequency
generated by the PLL is 200MHz, and if there are dividers in the core
clock, the core clock can generate frequencies = 200/x where x is the
divider value. Hence, there is no 1:1 relation between PLL clock table
and core clock table.

3. The CPUfreq table is dependent on the platform. There can be
platform level power/performance requirements due to which the number
of frequencies supported on the platform have to be restricted. With
multiple platforms supported in a single binary, there is  a need for
CPUFreq table != core clock table.

The CPUfreq operating points can be a subset of the core clock outputs
as required for power/performance requirements of a platform.

The APLL (P,M,S) values are independent of the core divider values. A
SoC can enforce limitations on the P,M,S values that should be
programmed on the PLL.

Also, there are two core clocks on a big-little system - one for big
cluster and one for little cluster.
