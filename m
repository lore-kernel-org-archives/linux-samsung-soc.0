I thought Rafael's work was for suspend/resume, not for runtime suspend.
Is it for both ? Because as far as I can tell this was painted to help
with suspend/resume ?

So you seek a run time power optimization ? Or a fix on suspend? Or both?

Thanks for the confirmation so really the biggest concern here was run time PM.

I see.. I think the audio folks already addressed this with DAPM, but granted
this was for audio. Then I was also referred to the DRM / Audio component
framework, has this been looked into? v4l folks have v4l async stuff but
its not clear if that help with run time PM. I'm mentioning these given it'd be
silly to re-invent the wheel, additionally if we now have a generic solution
everyone can jump on board with there is quite a bit of work we can do to
dump a lot of old legacy crap.

Thanks, this means nothing to me, however it would be value-add to the commit log
as anyone reviewing  this can understand what the goal / savings was for exactly.

I've heard this before, I don't buy it but lets see!
