Maybe s/MMC/eMMC here? to make more clear that this patch is solving
an issue when the eMMC and not the uSD is missing.

Yes, both the eMMC and uSD card detection lines in the Peach Pit/Pi
are connected to the XMMC0CDN and XMMC2CDN built-in CD# pins so is the
same than the Odroid XU3 if I read the schematics correctly since the
those pins are also GPC0_2 and GPC2_2.

Now, in the Peach Pit Chromebook the eMMC is not removable so card
detection is not an issue there, the problem I'm having is that card
detection for the uSD seems to be broken after adding Addy's patches:

mmc: dw_mmc: fix bug that cause 'Timeout sending command'
mmc: dw_mmc: Don't start command while data busy

And adding a cd-gpios property with a phandle to gpc2_2 to the mmc2
device node does not help.

But without those patches, I've timeouts when mmc commands are sent to
the SDIO slot which has the wifi chip connected to.

Your patch looks good to me though from what I've seen in the Odroid
XU3 schematic and taking into account that the eMMC can be removed in
that board.
