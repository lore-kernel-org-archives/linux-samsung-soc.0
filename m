Hi Lukasz,

I haven't replied yet as I wanted to see what the general feed of Rafael
is going to be :)

As this is something new and wasn't sure if we really want this..

That's not enough, Tell us why we should continue reading this mail..

Probably a better place would be tools/power/cpufreq/

@Rafael?

I couldn't make out the purpose of this test and why we need it. How do
we ensure that "cpufreq attributes exported by sysfs are exposing
correct values"?

And actually what do we mean by this statement even? What kind of errors can
be there in exposing these values.

I want to understand the purpose of this script very clearly first and then only
will look at the details.
