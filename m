Hi Tomasz,

This seems like a reasonable way of solving the problem, but I think
there is an even better one that we have about in the past: if we
promote syscon from a platform driver into a a drivers/base/ helper
that is independent of the platform device matching, we can use
call syscon_regmap_lookup_* for any device node, whether it's already
bound to a driver or not, which do what you need. It would also make
it easier to call the syscon code before the platform_device
infrastructure gets initialized, which is something a number of
people have asked for, e.g. for using regmap to do SMP bringup
or for clock registration.
