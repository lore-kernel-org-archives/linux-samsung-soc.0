Mostly because Maxime and I seem to have a completely different opinion
and nobody else argued one way or the other.

Sorry about missing this earlier, I hope the popcorn is not stale.

I think a reset that needs to be released before a fixed device appears
on the bus, should be handled by the bus driver. The reset framework
could be made to help with that, but I don't think a separate entity
that scans the whole device tree itself is the right solution.
