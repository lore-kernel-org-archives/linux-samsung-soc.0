Beside standardizing things, do you also like to take them one level higher to 
solve challenging issues ? I know the answer must be yes :-)

The problem at hand here is something we have solved in V4L2 (theoretically 
only for part of it) with the media controller API, the V4L2 subdevs and their 
pad-level format API.

In a nutshell, the media controller lets drivers model hardware as a graph of 
buliding blocks connected through their pads and expose that description to 
userspace applications. In V4L2 most of those blocks are V4L2 subdevs, which 
are abstract building blocks that implement sets of standard operations. Those 
operations are exposed to userspace through the V4L2 subdevs pad-level format 
API, allowing application to configure sizes and selection rectangles at all 
pads in the graph. Selection rectangles can be used to configure cropping and 
composing, which is exactly what the window positioning API needs to do.

Instead of creating a new fbdev-specific API to do the same, shouldn't we try 
to join forces ?
