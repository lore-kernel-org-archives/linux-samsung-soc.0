It's fairly new to have host bridges in loadable modules, so I'm pretty
sure it's not supported by the core yet, but it also doesn't seem hard
to do. I think you are right with regard to pci_remove_root_bus,
and Bjorn might be able to provide more information.

Ideally we should be able to load and unload the pci host driver
in a loop indefinitely without crashing or exposing any races
or leaks, but I would not bet on that working without bugs in the
core, since that goes beyond the normal pci (device) hotplug case.
