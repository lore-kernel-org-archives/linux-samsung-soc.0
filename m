Hi,

Apologies for being somewhat late w.r.t. review on this.

What is 'boost-mode'?

What are the limitations on boost frequencies? When is a CPU expected to
go to these frequencies and for now long? When should I as a dt author
place elements in boost-frequencies?

Why are these in both operating-points and boost-frequencies? It'll be
really easy to accidentally forget to mark something as a
boost-frequency this way. Why not have a boost-points instead?

This is more of a general issue, but I hate the whole cpufreq-cpu0 way
of assuming that all CPUs mirror CPU0.

It would be nicer if either this were dropped in /cpus or repeated
per-cpu.

Cheers,
Mark.
