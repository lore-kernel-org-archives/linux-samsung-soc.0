Yes, it solves both problems, although the suspend/resume was easy to 
workaround
just by using LATE_SLEEP_OPS.

It also helped to remove the suspend/resume workaround.

The main reason for using device links was to implement proper runtime power
optimization.

Right, probably some workarounds here and there can be removed. However 
components
and v4l-async solutions are for resolving only probe and registration 
issues and they
are some kind of pool for grouping devices and triggering special 
callback once all
requested devices in the pool have probed.

Somehow I managed to split this all-in-one patch into several smaller 
changes
in v5 and v6 was posted yesterday ago.
