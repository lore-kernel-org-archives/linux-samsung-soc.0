I was coming from the other angle: exynos is already using soc_is_*() in too
many places. I'd like to first see the ones cleaned up that really should be
doing something else because they have a device-local ID to look at.

If we end up with a couple of instances that don't have a good alternative,
we can use of_machine_is_compatible() for those, but I'd like to avoid doing
a blind conversion because that would likely lead to more instances in the
future, not fewer.

I agree that we should have to introduce new chip ID drivers on other
platforms for the purpose of finding out the SoC version, especially not
with private APIs.
