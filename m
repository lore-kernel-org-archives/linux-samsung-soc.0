* You forgot: status="okay" for the ADC.  One might question how this
patch was tested.

* Please also include this change for pi.

* We just got through the painful process of sorting this .dts file.
Please sort "&adc" alphabetically.  Kukjin: please confirm that you
will keep an eye on patches and make sure that they are sorted OK.


Other than those problems this seems to work fine to me.
