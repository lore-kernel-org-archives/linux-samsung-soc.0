I'll add detailed description of busfreq as following:

"busfreq(bus frequendcy)" driver means that busfreq driver control dynamically
memory bus frequency/voltage by checking memory bus utilization to optimize
power-consumption. When checking memeory bus utilization, exynos4_busfreq driver
would use PPMU(Performance Profiling Monitoring Units).

OK, I'll modify it as following:
the offset and length of the PPMU_DMC0 / PPMU_DMC1
PPMU_DMC0/PPMU_DMC1 show memory buy utilization to exynos4_bus driver.

I'll remove this description.

I'll expalin clocks as following:
	"ppmudmc0", "ppmudmc1"

I'll remove it about 'regs-name'.

I'll add detailed opeation method and role of exynos4_busfreq driver.
