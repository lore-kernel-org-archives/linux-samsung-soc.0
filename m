late_initcall can ensure DP driver is probed later.

As you mentioned, DP controller does not work without FIMD controller.
Because FIMD controller should provide video data and video clock to DP controller.
In this case, adding config dependency would be good.

If FIMD driver turns off pixel clock, DP should be turned off too.
Currently, FB FIMD driver turns off pixel clock in remove() and suspend().
So, FIMD driver is enabled, DP will not occur any error on pixel clock.
