Ah, OK.  Perhaps it's best to ignore me, then.  ;)  FYI: Russell's
Patch System is at <http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/developer/patches/>
and is used for getting individual patches into branches maintained by
Russel.  If you're just going to send a pull request for the series
then I don't think you need it.
