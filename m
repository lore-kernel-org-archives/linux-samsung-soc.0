Leave it, you clarify that is just indices.

Maybe we could rename these nodes to support the real name while running?
But it's just a detail I guess.

The cooling devices mapping is correct, it's the reporting in
/sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone$i/temp that are wrong.
Currently, there is no bad effect for cooling, as the attached cooling device
adapts the FAN and both frequencies of little and big cluster. Frequencies
of little cores and big cores are shared inside a cluster.
This patch is for coherency only.
