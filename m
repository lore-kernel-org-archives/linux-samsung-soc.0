Let me expand a bit more on the "if any" in my #2 above.  Most ARM 
sub-architectures don't have any special idle drivers and they simply 
rely on the default cpu_do_idle call.  What this proposed patch is doing 
is to move the rcu_idle_enter()/rcu_idle_exit() pair down into the few 
subarchs with an existing cpu-idle callback.  This means in practice 
that rcu_idle_enter()/rcu_idle_exit() wouldn't be called at all anymore 
on most ARM targets.  Is that appropriate?

I would have to know more about what the rcu_idle_*() calls imply before 
suggesting an alternative.
