Right, but why do you want to see these bus devices? AFAIU, they will
always behave exactly the same as LEFTBUS. Their PPMU counters will be
the same... or not? The MFC does not have its own PPMU counter. There
are separate counters for left and right bus... but they are attached t=
o
the "&bus_leftbus" node. The "&bus_rightbus" does not use the PPMU
counter and it follows the parent governor decisions... so this is
purely an artificial creation just to handle one clock.

I just can't see the benefit of such additional bus device.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
