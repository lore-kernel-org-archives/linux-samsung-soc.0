The single clock lines are not configured in the exynos5433 dts,
but in the drivers/clk/samsung/clk-exynos5433.c file and it's the
only place where we can set the flags.

Yes, because the audio codec is on SPI1 and its bus line
(spi_busclk0) is CLK_SCLK_SPI1_PERIC while the CLK_SCLK_SPI1 is
set as CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED.

nope! :(

For some reasons, if you set in the DTS as spi_busclk0 the
CLK_SCLK_SPI1 from cmu_peric you get a synchronus abort in the
s3c64xx_spi_config (the first read performed on the device).
