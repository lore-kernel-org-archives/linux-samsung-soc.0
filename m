I already discussed the Rob's question on December, last year on
patchset[1]. But, after that, I didn't receive the any reply from him.
[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/10/943

So, I thought that there is no comment.  But, today, he give some
question after 4 months.

But I'll again reply to Rob's question.
