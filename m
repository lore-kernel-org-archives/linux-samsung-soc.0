if multiple slot is supported, then a mmcqd should be processing for multiple slots.
It's too inefficient, and affect the whole performance reduction.

If want to offer the second slot for user expansion, add the host for expansion slot.
Almost All SoC didn't use the multiple slot per a host controller for eMMC/SD/SDIO.

If Some device(Phone) supports the SD-card and eMMC, then there are two Host IP.
One Host IP is used for eMMC, other is used for SD-card.

this is H/W design issue.

a) You means the below,

One Host IP -------- eMMC
		|
		---- SD
		|
		---- SDIO

b) We means the below
One Host IP -------- eMMC
One Host IP -------- SD
One Host IP -------- SDIO

In now, I knew every SoC have used like b) type. I didn't see a) type (especially, dwmmc's case).

If i missed something, let me know, plz.
