I know that Exynos5420/5422/5800 is related to part #4 and not #3 but I
wanted to answer in this thread since here is where Kevin reported the
issue. I tried your next-20150330-generic-cpufreq-exynos5420-5800-v2-debug
branch with exynos_defconfig plus CONFIG_BL_SWITCHER disabled and:

CONFIG_ARM_BIG_LITTLE_CPUFREQ=y
CONFIG_ARM_DT_BL_CPUFREQ=y

By default CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y but with that option it fails
to boot as well on my Exynos5420 Peach Pit so seems to be exactly what Kevin
reported on the Exynos5800 Peach Pi Chromebook.

Disabling CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE and the performance
governor and enabling the userpace governor and setting it as default
makes the kernel to boot again which is the same behaviour Kevin had.

Also I can see that the CPUS have a cpufreq and the scaling driver
is the arm b.L one:

# cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_driver 
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little
arm-big-little

I don't have CPUIdle enabled since as you said is not turned on in exynos
defconfig by default so I think that is just a red herring.

The last boot log shown on the serial console with your debug branch is:

[    3.078885] cpu cpu0: _get_cluster_clk_and_freq_table: clk: ee516a80 & freq table: ee511540, cluster: 0

[    3.182305] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 60000186

so it seems to be a bug in the code and not about OPPs not functional due
voltage scaling not working as Kevin guessed.

However, as Kevin mentioned is strange that the regulator voltages are -1
as you can see in the above boot log.

Also when setting a scaling_setspeed to one of the scaling available
frequencies for a given CPU, I see in the log that the frequency is
scaled for all the cluster and correctly reported in scaling_cur_freq
but the scaled voltage is always reported as -1 again:

[  899.002840] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate_cluster: cpu 0, cluster: 0, 1800 MHz, -1 mV --> 1100 MHz, -1 mV

[  975.328748] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate: cpu: 4, old cluster: 1, new cluster: 1, freq: 1200000
[  975.336663] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate_cluster: cpu 4, cluster: 1, 600 MHz, -1 mV --> 1200 MHz, -1 mV
