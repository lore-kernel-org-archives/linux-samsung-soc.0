If we eventually have a need beyond cpufreq (say devfreq) with similar
instances, then it makes sense to move it out to a generic place.
Either way, code implementation/duplication is a OS problem - and
should be looked at independent of the description in dts. If we feel
the description is valid hardware description (which, personally, I
do), then lets go to the next discussion point of where to put it -
generic or cpufreq specific (here, I have no preference), and finally
decide the implementation as necessary as a result of the description.
