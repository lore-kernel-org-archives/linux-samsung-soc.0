Hi,

I do not understand this sentence. In DTSI, the CPU0-3 are the A7,
little cores. Defined by exynos5422-cpus.dtsi. What did you mean here?

There are 8 CPUs (4 little and 4 big) but only 4 thermal zones for
CPUs. The mapping of names of CPU nodes and TMU nodes in DTS is not
direct. These are just indices ... although more important is to map
the cooling devices to proper TMU. This should be mentioned in DTS as
this the real problem here.

Do not leave commented lines, there are not needed.

Also your email does not match signed-off-by. You must have something
wrong with either git setup or mailer (git commit --si will use the
same address for From and SoB so I guess the mailer...).

Best regards,
