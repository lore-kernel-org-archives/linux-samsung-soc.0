It's not clear what subsystems affect state of the CG_STATUSx registers, it
would be good if we could get more information on that. They are in the PMU
block and are related to LPI (Low Power Interface handshaking), but what
subsystems/peripheral blocks exactly are associated with them it's not clear
from the documentation.

I think it's essential to understand what triggers changes in CG_STATUSx
registers, before we start checking their value in the clock driver.

Also it might be that there are indeed some clocks which must stay enabled
over suspend/resume cycle, then the approach with enabling/disabling clocks
in the clock driver might not be such a hack as it looks at first sight.

No, please don't do that. That includes many important clocks and we should
be certain what we are doing. I don't think it is expected to touch those
clocks in that way, it would likely cause more issues.
