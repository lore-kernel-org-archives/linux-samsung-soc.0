Is there problem that move the s3c_sdhci_platdata struct into linux/mmc/?
In setup-gpio- files, you can see that included regs-sdhci.h.
But defined macro in regs-sdhci.h only used in sdhci-s3c.c.
So i think no problem that removed "#include <plat/regs-sdhci.h>". is it wrong?
Just touching the setup-gpio- files is problem?
If i have moved the defined as "extern", it's problem.
But i didn't move them.

For example, When i want to add the second capability for sdhci-s3c,
need to change code in samsung-soc and mmc stack.
if one of both didn't be merged, it's conflict or should not be work fine.
(Now, in mmc-next tree, mmc for Samsung-SoC didn't work fine during long time.)
There are reason that move the s3c_sdhci_platdata into linux/mmc/.
Then we can work at only mmc-next repository for sdhci-s3c.c.

Right, it should be conflicted with your patch. but it will be fixed.
It's not big problem.

Thanks for your opinion.
