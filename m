And, I just found another issue:

On exynos5800-peach-pi, setting the cpufreq default governor to
performance at compile time (CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE=y)
makes the kernel boot hang when the cpufreq driver is initialized.

However, setting the compile-time default to the userspace governor, and
then setting the performance governor via sysfs after the boot finishes
seems to work fine.
