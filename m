Yeah, I still don't know why is behaving differently.

Ok, thanks a lot.

I'll see how I can measure but it seems the system is suspended
correctly and the problem is on resuming (more on that below).

I did further testing by enabling some PM debug options
(CONFIG_PM_DEBUG and  CONFIG_PM_ADVANCED_DEBUG) and tested different
suspend modes (freezer, devices, processors and core).

With the three first modes, s2r worked correctly but when trying the
core mode the non-boot CPUs failed to come online again. I tested that
this works on other Exynos SoCs (5250 and 4412):

# grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo
8
# echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
# echo mem > /sys/power/state
...
Enabling non-boot CPUs ...
CPU1: failed to come online
Error taking CPU1 up: -5
CPU2: failed to come online
Error taking CPU2 up: -5
CPU3: failed to come online
Error taking CPU3 up: -5
CPU4: failed to come online
Error taking CPU4 up: -5
CPU5: failed to come online
Error taking CPU5 up: -5
CPU6: failed to come online
Error taking CPU6 up: -5
CPU7: failed to come online
Error taking CPU7 up: -5
...
# grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo
1

The -5 (-EIO) error is because even though the call to
exynos_boot_secondary() succeeds in _cpu_up() [0],
secondary_start_kernel() [1] is never called so the CPU is not marked
as online nor the cpu_running completion handler is waked up. So
waiting for it in _cpu_up() times out and cpu_online(cpu) is false.

I still didn't figure out why the secondary CPUs are not jumping into
their expected entry point so any hints are welcomed.

Maybe that is the difference in our setups...
