=46or Peach Pit and Pi, the matching DTS changes is [0]. But answering =
your
question it is to instantiate the subdevices that can be child nodes of=
 either
cros-ec-spi or cros-ec-i2c. So for the devices that are directly connec=
ted to
the EC Cortex-M through i2c.

Spring is a little more complicated since the EC in Spring don't have t=
he full
EC_CMD_I2C_PASSTHRU. So the downstream Chrome OS 3.8 kernel has a forke=
d
tps65090 driver (drivers/regulator/cros_ec-tps65090.c) that talks direc=
tly with
the cros_ec MFD driver, you can get more info from [1] in the "About Sp=
ring"
section.
