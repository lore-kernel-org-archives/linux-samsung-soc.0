Ok. But that would mean that we implment the clk_get_rate() function
for such clocks again. For example, to get the rate of the aclk_200
clock, its parent clock would have to be divided and then displayed.
But it was easier to just use the clk_get api. But yes I agree, this
is not a compelling reason to register all the clocks.

Ok. Thanks for your comments. I will redo this patch series.
