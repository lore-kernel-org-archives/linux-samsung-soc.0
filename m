I interpreted commit 383ffda2fa as a commit that just removed a lot of
stuff: see its commit explanation and its diffstat (it adds one line and
deletes over 900 lines). Moreover, after that commit the references to
MACH_SMDKV310 and MACH_SMDKC210 both are nops. Deleting them can't
possibly change anything.

But, anyhow, what would be the symbols to use here?

I do try to use subject lines that are used in the sections I touch. I
seem to remember that you asked me _once_, I think one or two years ago,
to adjust to the system used for SoC. Since then you've received a
number of patches from me that, as far as I can remember, always used
that system.

Besides, this patch was intended as a follow up to commit 383ffda2fa, to
clean up two references it apparently forgot to remove, and therefor
basically copied the subject line used in that commit.
