That's correct.

Well, the idea is to use them as a driver's or subsystem's .runtime_suspend()
and .runtime_resume() callbacks, or a PM domain's .stop_device() and
.start_device() callbacks, but I don't see fundamental arguments against
calling them directly.

Yes, it is gone now.

That sounds like a good idea.
