Boot tested Origen 4210, 4412 and Arndale boards after applying Thomas
Abraham's chip-id dt support patches.
They all boot fine.

However I could not see multiplatform support for Exynos in
exynos_defconfig (i.e., CONFIG_ARCH_EXYNOS and
CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM are not set together). This was available in
your 'samsung/exynos-multiplatform' branch. Has this been disabled in
next?
