That sounds good compared to adding hacks in DT files.

Atleast on Exynos 4210 and 4412 Origen boards the 2.8V MMC supply is derived
directly from the 5V input DC supply and hence it is always on.

Probably. I haven't verified for the other boards. Hence would be good to handle
this case in the driver itself.
