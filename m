Good.  So would it be possible to use struct of_node instead of
struct device_node in struct generic_pm_domain?

Sure.

My point was that adding the struct device_node pointer to
struct generic_pm_domain didn't look good, because that structure didn't
represent a device in general.  While I understand that it may be regarded
as a "device object" on some platforms, there are platforms that don't
regard PM domains as devices.  For this reason (and only for this reason)
it appears to be more appropriate to use a more generic device tree node
type for struct generic_pm_domain.

Thanks,
Rafael
