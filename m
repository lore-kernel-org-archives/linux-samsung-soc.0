Yup, I've seen that.  Patch 1/2 ("mmc: dw_mmc: exynos: Stop claiming
wp-gpio") addressed that.  For some reason I can't find that on
LKML.org yet.  Strange.  :-/  I'll forward it on to you shortly.

In any case: I found that the exynos code didn't actually work.  It
claimed the GPIO but didn't ever look at it.

I have the beginnings of the code to implement this properly in the
exynos code but I stopped working on it when I decided that other SoCs
could also benefit from the code and it fit better in the general
dw_mmc driver.

If you disagree and would like me to cleanup the version of this patch
that's just in the exynos driver and post that, I will.  Just let me
know.


Thanks for the review!
