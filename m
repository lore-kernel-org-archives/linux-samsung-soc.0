Do you mean that a patch with a known regression has been merged
into next branch of mmc tree?  It would be quite sad if it would be
true.

Unfortunately this patch doesn't fix the problem (there is no longer
a lockup on regulators initialization but -22 error is still present).

It also doesn't look that bad for me and well, when the hardware is
quirky then the resulting code can't be esthetically perfect..

I worry that I have too little time and MMC code expertise to do this.
