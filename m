I've applied above patches with small subject changes.

BTW unfortunately, since missing the
"include/dt-bindings/thermal/thermal_exynos.h" in my tree, I couldn't
merge it into for-next yet.

Can you please provide a topic branch for it? If not, this cannot be
handled in arm-soc tree in this time, I think.
