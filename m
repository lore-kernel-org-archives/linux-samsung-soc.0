We would really like to merge as much as possible from our current
development tree:
http://git.infradead.org/users/kmpark/linux-2.6-samsung/shortlog/refs/heads/SPRC-2.6.34-rc5-opensource

Some of the patches that we depend on are still in the review phase (s5p timer), some should be replaced by the ones that were
posted recently. Especially most of our patches depend on S5PV210 GPIO support, so without it we cannot go further. Is there any
chance to get it merged quickly? I will rebase our tree asap the mentioned patches get merged.

Best regards
