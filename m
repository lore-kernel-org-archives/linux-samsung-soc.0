According to our hardware engineer,
He said that
"That's correct. We tested it by doing a memory write from the device.
A device DMA is a series of memory r/w so I expect it to work same way."

Also, he thought that I already tested too, since it works after removing
the functions.

I looked at the pci-mvebu driver,
Then I fixed it as the pci-mvebu driver did.
Also, I added 'global_io_offset'.

In this case, boot message is as below:

I will remove a 'remove' callback. Is it OK?
Or what should I do?


Thank you for your comment. :)
