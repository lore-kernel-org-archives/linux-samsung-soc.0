 Optional Property:
  - gpios : Should be added if a gpio line is required to drive PERST# line
 
+NOTE: Two dt nodes should be added for each PCI controller; one for host
+mode and another for device mode. So in order for PCI to
+work in host mode, EP mode dt node should be disabled and in order to PCI to
+work in EP mode, host mode dt node should be disabled. And host mode and EP
+mode are mutually exclusive.

 Example:
 axi {
 	compatible = "simple-bus";
