This series consists mostly of clock changes and it likely depends on
patches already in my for-next, so I would be inclined toward taking it
through samsung-clk tree. However, for this I would need Acks for patch
5/6 from Viresh and for patches [1] and [2] (which are dependencies of
this series) from you. I also need to make sure that the two mentioned
patches don't have any dependencies already in your tree.

[1] ARM: dts: add CPU nodes for Exynos4 SoCs
   - https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/21/315
[2] ARM: dts: smdk5250: Specify MAX77686 pmic interrupt
