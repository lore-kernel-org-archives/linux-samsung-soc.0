Hmm, could you elaborate on the idea of using mask instead of field widths? 
I don't see how this could be better and there is an additional drawback of 
having to calculate width and pos from every mask.

Anyway, back to your concern, the values that are written to the bit fields 
specified by those bindings are arbitrary SoC-specific values anyway, so 
if, for example, we get a SoC with following register layout:

bits:    7 | 6 - 4  | 3 | 2 - 0
meaning: 0 | func 1 | 0 | func 0

or

bits:    7 - 5  | 4 | 3 - 1  | 0
meaning: func 1 | 0 | func 0 | 0

we can easily define the width as 4 and use appropriate 4-bit function 
values with zeroes on reserved positions.

The binding I proposed covers all Samsung SoCs currently available, 
starting from s3c24xx, through s3c64xx (except 4bit2 bank type, with two 
function registers), to the whole Exynos series, including latest Exynos5.
