Hello Sergei,

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

True, I forgot that the ePAPR recommends that the node names should be
somewhat generic but OTOH this is the only Exynos DTSI file that follows
the standard for the power domain device nodes. All other Exynos DTSI
use a prefix to differentiate between each power domain.

Well, the full node name is also not very useful IMHO since you have
to check the DTSI or SoC manual to map the device node unit-address to
the corresponding power domain.

I used $subject when debugging an HDMI issue and instead of dropping
it, I just posted it in case someone considered useful. I don't really
mind if the patch is nacked / not picked.

Best regards,
Javier
