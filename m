I would like to remove __clk_lookup some day, so the fewer users now the
better. Additionally, now that we have unique struct clk pointers from
clk_get it makes a lot of sense for clk_register to stop returning
pointers to a struct clk. Hopefully we can get around to that soon.

These two points above are enough reason for the clock provider to use
clk_get.

This seems like a big hack to me.

I'd like to understand the issue a bit further. Isn't the correct
solution that the clk's prepare/unprepare and enable/disable callbacks
should support the CG_STATUS requirement?
