Display interfaces may be described by an arbitrary number of parameters. 
Some will require just video timings, others like DSI will require a 
significant number of additional bus-specific ones.

Separating all the parameters (all of which are usually set at the same 
time) into a lot of ops setting single parameter will just add unnecessary 
complexity.

Hmm, isn't it in the opposite direction (the user requests the display 
interface to change, for example, video mode, which in turn reconfigures 
the link and requests the panel to update its settings)?

However it might be reasonable to split the parameters into constant and 
variable ones. In case of DSI bus, there is a lot of parameters that are 
considered just at link initialization time (the whole dsi params struct I 
defined). Video mode, however, is a variable parameter that can be changed 
on some displays.

Hmm, I don't remember at the moment, will have to look to the 
specification. Exynos DSI master doesn't support such feature.

Yes, this is a problem that requires a bit more thought.

I've been discussing this issue with Sylwester and we came to a conclusion 
that for sure a display entity can normally get a reference to its video 
source (e.g. module_get, to prevent unloading the module), as there should 
be no possibility of video source going away, leaving display entity 
present and so there is no need for unregistering a bound video source. 
This is what I implemented in my code.

Now it shall be possible to unregister a bound display entity, for example 
to have the ability of unplugging a hotpluggable display (HDMI, Display 
Port), but this will need some non-trivial synchronization. I'm still 
thinking how to do it properly.
