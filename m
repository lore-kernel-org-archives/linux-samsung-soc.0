Fair enough.

Still, I expect code that enters the kernel to actually be tested.
We've got way too much code just sitting there in broken state because
whomever posted it didn't care about it working at the time, and
nobody knows better because you can't actually use the code/driver on
any real hardware with a mainline kernel.
