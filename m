Sorry, I was not aware of this. I will take care in future.

Ok as per our last discussion you mentioned that clps71xx will be soon
migrating to DT.
So if that is not going to happen sooner, I would also prefer better keep
syscon_regmap_lookup_by_pdevname and syscon platform_driver for non-DT case,
so that this issue should not block this patch.

So please let's make final call to keep syscon platform_driver for non-DT
case which eventually
can be dropped once clps71xx driver migrates to DT based. So that I can
prepare next patchset
keeping syscon platform_driver support  and syscon_regmap_lookup_by_pdevname
API support
for non-DT case and send across for review.

At least we could not see any issues with this. We have tested it one
Exynos5250 board
where syscon object is getting created first time when other drivers (USB,
SATA Phy, Watchdog)
are calling helper function syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle and able to
access regmap handle
and able to use regmap_read/write APIs.
