The primary ask for that has been to enable runtime_pm for drivers. It's not
a new ask, but we somehow haven't gotten around to do it.

Yes, but do bear in mind that some cases do need atomic prepare. The primary
cases for DMA had that in mind and also submitting next transaction from the
callback (tasklet) context, so that won't go away.

It would help in other cases where clients know that they will not be in
atomic context so we provide additional non-atomic "allocation" followed by
prepare, so that drivers can split the work among these and people can do
runtime_pm and other things..

Yes this is an interesting point. Yes till now people have been doing above
to workaround this problem, but hey this is not a unique to dmaengine. Any
subsystem which provides services to others has this issue, so the solution
much be driver or pm framework and not unique to dmaengine.

Well setting those links is not practical at initialization time. Most
modern dma controllers feature a SW mux, with multiple clients connecting
and requesting, would we link all of them? Most of times dmaengine driver
wont know about those..
