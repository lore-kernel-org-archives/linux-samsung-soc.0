Overall it looks good to me. I'm only a bit uncomfortable with using 
SAMSUNG_
prefix for the clock index definitions. Ideally it should be something more
specific to the SoC family. But I can't think of anything better at the 
moment.
This covers the Exynos and S5P SoCs, hence EXYNOS_ would not be appropriate.
