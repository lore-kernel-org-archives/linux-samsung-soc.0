I found this link from hardkernel website which specify the interface support

http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G141578491347

Manufacturer Part Number : Sandisk SDSDQAD-016G
Interface : UHS-1 SDR50

I don't know much internal specification of the Odroid XU3/XU4 Boards.

I am not sure if it will support host will sd-uhs-sdr104, but it will
be compatible for sd-uhs-sdr12, sd-uhs-sdr25, sd-uhs-sdr50.
