We could consider main, sub and extint as three separate interrupt
controllers and thus three different nodes in device tree. So the
interrupt nodes could be something like (referring to 2416 manual).

     main@0x4a000000 {
            compatible =3D "samsung,s3c2410-main";
            reg =3D <0x4a000000 0x100>;
            interrupt-controller;
            #interrupt-cells =3D <2>;
     };

     sub@0x4a001000 {
            compatible =3D "samsung,s3c2410-sub";
            reg =3D <0x4a001000 0x100>;
            interrupt-controller;
            #interrupt-cells =3D <2>;
            interrupt-parent =3D <&main>;
            interrupts =3D <28 0>, <23 0>, <.....  /*uart0/uart1/..*/
     };

     eint@0x4a002000 {
            compatible =3D "samsung,s3c2410-eint";
            reg =3D <0x4a002000 0x100>;
            interrupt-controller;
            #interrupt-cells =3D <2>;
            interrupt-parent =3D <&main>;
            interrupts =3D <0 0>, <1 0>,
                              <2 0>, <3 0>,
                              <4 0>, <5 0>;
     };

There should be a corresponding irqchip driver code to handle each of
these types of controllers. They should have their own irq-domain
supported.

Then the client nodes can specify the interrupt parent and interrupt
number. For example, the uart node would be

       uart@50000000 {
            compatible =3D "samsung,s3c2410-uart";
            reg =3D <0x50000000 0x100>;
            interrupt-parent =3D <&sub>;
            interrupts =3D <0 0>, <1 0>, <2 0>; /*tx/rx/err*/
       };

Writing the nodes with the correct interrupt parent and the interrupt
number should take care of this.

I have brought up this point just for discussion. You could choose the
implementation that you prefer. I understand that implementing with
different interrupt controller nodes might require lot of code
changes.

Thanks,
Thomas.
