Sure, this is the case right now. And I thought I'd copied this property
name from some other driver, but it looks like I'm mistaken.

I was simply pointing out that there are already some properties in this
area. It'd be nice if we could unify everything on a single style; either
expanding the existing "sdhci,1-bit-only" style that Rob mentioned, or
expanding the "support-8bit" style that Tegra currently uses, rather than
adding a third way of indicating this. Still, given the early state of
DT on Tegra, I'd be happy migrating Tegra to whatever single unified
approach is chosen, so don't take my comments as nak'ing your patch or
anything like that.
