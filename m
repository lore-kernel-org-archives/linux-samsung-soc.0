Subject: [PATCH v8] drivers: amba: properly handle devices with power domains

To read pid/cid registers, the probed device need to be properly turned on.
When it is inside a power domain, the bus code should ensure that the
given power domain is enabled before trying to access device's registers.
However in some cases power domain (or clocks) might not be yet available.
Returning -EPROBE_DEFER is not a solution in such case, because callers
don't handle this special error code. Instead such devices are added to the
special list and their registration is retried from periodic worker until
all resources are available.

Changelog:

v8:
- replaced notifier with periodic workqueue on Greg request

v7: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/13/201
- replaced late_initcall approach with a notifier registered to device core

v6: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/12/414
- got back to v1-style approach on Russell King request to avoid ABI break
- use list for storing deferred devices and retry their registration from
  late_initcall

v5: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/2/10/179
- added 2 more patches to avoid regression with existing drivers (nvdimm and
  sa1111), for more information, see https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/17/390
- changed thread name to "AMBA: add complete support for power domains"

v4: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/2/52
- fixed more issues pointed by Ulf Hansson and Russell King

v3: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/1/334
- fixed issues pointed by Ulf Hansson
- dropped patch for exynos4210 dts, because it already got queued for merging

v2: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/11/26/229
- added 2 patches from 'On-demand device probing' thread
  (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/29/189), which move PID/CIR reading
  from amba_device_add() to amba_match()
- moved dev_pm_domain_attach() to amba_match(), which is allowed to
  return -EPROBE_DEFER

v1: http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg463185.html
- initial version
