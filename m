You've described two of the possible cases, but not the third.  In the
third case, you have a gpio line that is not independent of the SDHCI,
because it is the SDHCI's CD pin brought out to be directly accessible
via a GPIO.

The difference is in the handling of the interrupt -- if you don't have
"cd-external" then you're just using the SDHCI's interrupt, but if you
have an independent line then you're going to need to register your own
IRQ handler on it, and "cd-external" signifies that.

Thanks,
