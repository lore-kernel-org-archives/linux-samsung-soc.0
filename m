To Kukjin Kim,

As you said, should we separately control power and clock of power domain?
or Have to turn on the clock of power domain always?
I think that it is to happen unnecessary power consumption.
If we have to maintain on state of power domain clock, please let me know
guide about this.

Also,
For example, fimg2d and framebuffer use LCD0 power domain as parent device.I
If fimg2d and framebuffer is disabled state due to not using their,
I think that we should turn off the clock of LCD0 power domain to reduce
power leakage.
Which each regarding device driver control the clock of power domain?

I will expect for your reply.

Best regards,
Chanwoo Choi
