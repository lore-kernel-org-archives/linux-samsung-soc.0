Framework may do few things, since hardware elements are also different
for devices.

So, my suggestion is do like mmc does (like this patch set does). The
reasons like belows:

- This piece of power sequence code needs to work like device driver, not
library, it is easy to manage resources using device driver.
- The device on the bus has still not been found, so this piece of code
can't be in device driver on each subsystem.
- We need to have a place for these power sequences drivers

Ideally, I hope it can work like regulator class, but it seems hard to
compatible with current mmc-pwrseq DT node.
