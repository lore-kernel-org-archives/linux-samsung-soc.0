Thanks for updating this patchset.  There are still some minor issues
left though:

- patch #4 should be at beginning of the patch series

- moving of devfreq_unregister_opp_notifier(dev, data->devfreq) from
  exynos4_bus_exit() to exynos4_busfreq_remove() should be in patch #4
  (which should really be at the beggining of patch series) not #3

- handling of iounmap(data->ppmu[i].hw_base) should be added to
  exynos4_bus_exit() in patch #2 not #3

- patch #8 summary and description should mention fact that it adds DT
  binding documentation (not the driver itself) and the patch itself
  can be slighlty polished

One important note about this patchset not mentioned in the cover
letter is that it is improving currently unused driver (because of
DT-only mach-exynos conversion the only user was removed in June 2013
and from the reading the code I suspect that even that user hadn't
worked previously).  As such this patch series should not cause any
regressions.
