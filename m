Hi Herbert, thanks for the reply.  Sorry for the delay in my response,
I just got a chance to look at this again with the information you
provided.

It looks like the driver is rejecting the encryption request, and is
calling xfrm_output_resume with -22 (-EINVAL) because in
s5p_set_indata() this driver is calling sg_dma_len() on the sg lists
from the crypto request and getting back something that isn't a
multiple of AES_BLOCK_SIZE, and thus decides that this isn't a valid
request.

In my particular test, It looks like it's getting a dma size of
either 92 or 124 bytes while AES_BLOCK_SIZE is 16 bytes, and neither
of those are multiples of 16. I looked into why this was happening and
it looks like in eseqiv_givencrypt() we're calling
ablkcipher_request_set_crypt() with a value of either 80 or 112 (which
is a multiple of AES_BLOCK_SIZE) while reqctx->src->length is 96 or
124.

I think this is happening because the sg list associated with the
request has been set up for a network transfer, which is of a larger
size than what needs to be encrypted due to additional network
headers.

So, I'm wondering, is it correct for the HW crypto driver to be using
this sg list, which is part of the request , or should it somehow be
using different sg lists with the proper length for it's DMA
operations, or should that be happening somewhere else in the network
stack?
