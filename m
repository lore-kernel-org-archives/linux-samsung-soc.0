Even without that patch we've still pretty much stopped everything in
dw_mci_fifo_reset(), so I'm not sure there's any strong dependency.
...but in our tree this did land after the patch you mention, so you
could wait until it lands if you want.


NOTE: We found that on some machines we were getting warnings after
enabling tuning and using this patch.  The warnings were benign, but
we should probably squash the fix into this patch.  See
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/200652/> for details.
