Btw, "static char s3c2410ts_name[]" will save you a pointer. But, it
looks like it is used only once, in probe(), so just put it there.

Ah, I wasn't requiesting to remove the documentation, I was just saying
that since these data structures and fucntions are driver-provate they
don't need to use kernel-doc style.

Just update your tslib, the issue was fixed there last November.

No, it is my personal preference/style. In case when it is used like:

	var = blah();
	if (var)
		goto err_unblah;

	return 0;

err_unblah:
	unblah();
	return var;
}

I prefer that var called 'error'. If the value is returned on both error
and success paths then I call it 'ret', 'retval', etc.

But no, if you prefer 'ret' that is fine too.

As long as it does not break when CONFIG_PM is not set...
