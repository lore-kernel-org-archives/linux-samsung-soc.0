Hi Arnd/Rob/Mike et al,

We didn't conclude anything out of this thread and so kicking it
again as we need to close bindings to support cpufreq-cpu0
better for platforms not sharing clock lines across all CPUs.

There can be platform drivers which also depend on these properties
and picking cpufreq-cpu0 on this basis doesn't look correct.

Correct and there can be other platform drivers which cannot use
cpufreq-cpu0 (though I am trying to force people to use cpufreq-cpu0
instead of a new driver).

Is something terribly wrong with having a property at 'cpus' node
which can point to the driver we want to use? Like:

        cpus {
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;
                scaling-method = "cpufreq-cpu0"

                cpu@0 {
                        ....
                };

                ....
        };

Or if we can reuse compatibility string some way.

Probably we have mixed both the problems. We have two problems to
solve:
- Identifying which driver to probe for a platform, earlier explanation
I tried to gave were around that..

- Identifying if clocks are shared between CPUs? If yes which ones?

Probably Mike's suggestions were around this second problem, but
I still couldn't make out which CPUs share clock line from his
examples.

Please see if we can close this thread soon... Few platforms are waiting
to reuse cpufreq-cpu0 :)
