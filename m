Yes sure I'm aware of this. It should be easy to profile the
speed gain to see if it would make much of a difference
before starting to tinker with that.

The way I think it's possible to do would be to copy the TWD
timer value to a wake-up capable gptimer before hitting any
deeper idle state. Of course some aux timer support might be
still needed :)
