OK, so let's say that muxes should start at 640 and dividers at 768.

Anyway, ideally, we should break from this idea of grouping and convert 
this way of definition to normal preprocessor macros that could be used 
inside dts files as well. Then we could detach ourselves from referring to 
clocks by numbers, because those macros would do that for us, without the 
need to group clocks together for better readability. See clock driver for 
S3C64xx [1].

This is an idea for further work, though. For now the values I proposed 
should be more than enough.
