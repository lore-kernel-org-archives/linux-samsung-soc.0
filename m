Yes.

Correct. At MMC_POWER_OFF, all host drivers shall turn off all the
possible powers that goes to the card. I am just telling this to make
sure, we don't think this is a dw_mmc specific thing.

Got it. :-)

Currently MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL mean the mmc rescan work will reschedule
itself with HZ interval. This to check for card insert/removal.

Now, mmc_rescan() will, if present, invoke host's ->get_cd() callback
to check whether it's worth to continue initialization sequence or if
it should re-schedule itself again.

If your host driver can distinguish whether a card is inserted, which
in this the are when vccq is turned off, your ->get_cd() callback need
to return 0. That will allow mmc_rescan() to continue it's
initialization sequence and do mmc_power_up().

Nope.

Kind regards
