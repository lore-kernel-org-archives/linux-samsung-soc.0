Ah, ok. But in that case what you said in an earlier mail is not quite
correct: "I think this approach is less platform dependant, as long as
there is no SoC that take more than a blanking period to reconfigure.".
So in your approach the reconfiguration doesn't have to be done inside
the blanking period, but before the panel's picture starts to fade?

I don't know... It's early Monday morning, and not enough coffee yet,
but I get a bit uneasy feeling if I think that your method of
reconfiguring would be the only think allowed by the CDF API.

Some SoCs do support reconfiguring on the fly, without disabling the
link. It would not be nice if we didn't allow this to happen. And
actually, we're not only talking about SoCs here, but also any display
devices, like external buffer chips etc. They may also offer means to
change configs on the fly.

Well, I don't have any hard point about this at the moment, but I think
we should think different approaches how the configuration can be done.

I think one case where this kind of pin configuration is needed, and
which also dictates that all panel related configuration has to be in
the panel's data, not in the DSI master's data, is hotplug.

If you have a board that has two panels connected to the same video
output, probably via some kind of mux, at least for the sensitive pins
like DSI, only one of the panels can be enabled at a time. The panels
can have different wiring, and thus the panel driver would need to
configure everything related to the bus when it's starting up.

The same also happens if you have a true hotplug, i.e. you can remove
the panel totally and plug in a new one. Again the wiring can be
different, and needs to be set up.

And, as I said, this means that all relevant data about the video bus
has to be in the panel's data, so that each panel can have its own set
of, say, pin configuration.

Hotplug is not a use case we should aim to support for the CDF v1, but I
think we should strive not to prevent hotplug either. So if we can
design the API so that hotplug is possible, I say let's do that.
