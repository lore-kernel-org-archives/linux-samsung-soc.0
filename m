OK I will add a list here and above in 'clock-names' in the right order.

I should have changed it after I moved the lpddr3.txt files in the doc
dir. I missed it, my apologies.

As Krzysztof commented in the next message, the chipid register contains
information about memory size and the clock register set has some
registers from DMC (timings settings) which are not typical 'clocks'.
Chanwoo suggested to use syscon regmap to access these clock registers
safely. Krzysztof suggested to use syscon regmap similar to Sylwester's
AVS driver while accessing chipid registers.
That's why they are here. Both register sets contain needed information
for proper operation of the driver.
