But there is no 'device tree' bus.  The bus type we're
dealing with is a platform bus.

vfio for platform devices should be independent of whether
the device was discovered in a device tree or not.
All you're doing is exposing mappable regions and IRQs
to user space and it does not matter where the info originated.

You should be using platform bus structs here not
reparsing device tree nodes.  The struct
platform_device already has resource info in the 
struct:

struct platform_device {
        const char      *name;
        u32             id;
        struct device   dev;
        u32             num_resources;
        struct resource *resource;
};
