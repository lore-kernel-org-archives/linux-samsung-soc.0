Hi,

Firstly, thanks for working on this.

The patch looks fine overall for me, some review comments below.

I'm not entirely convinced that the new approach is better.

With the old approach exynos_rng_generate() can be called more
than once before PM autosuspend kicks in and thus clk_prepare_enable()/
clk_disable()_unprepare() operations will be done only once. This
would give better performance on the "burst" operations.

[ The above assumes that clock operations are more costly than
  going through PM core to check the current device state. ]

I know that this is copied verbatim from the old driver but please
use define for the maximum number of retries.

How this condition could ever happen? 

The probe function will never be called twice.
