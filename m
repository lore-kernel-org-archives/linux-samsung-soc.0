The point I'm trying to make is that we won't 'always' know the device names in
advance.
Btw how are you planning to differentiate between multiple controllers of the
same type with con_id?

Maybe I'm missing the actual intention of this patch. Do you face problem if
the PHY's have to know about it's consumers in ACPI?

In this case, the lookup table will be used only for non-dt boot so don't see
much use in moving to mfd driver.
I meant if the new method is not solving any problem then I would prefer the
way it is modelled now where the PHY's know about it's consumers.

Btw where does device gets created in ACPI boot?
