Cool! This is the only major issue I'm aware of, so I think we're good.

If SPARSEMEM support is still relevant to anybody, I'm sure we can
get that to work as well.

There is one small issue with the sound drivers that came up, and I
assume it was just a mistake. If not, some more work on that might
be needed. See patch below.

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: samsung: don't build pcm and spdif on exynos

In commit d37bdf736d9b "ASoC: samsung: Use ASoC dmaengine code where
possible", Mark Brown changed the EXYNOS ASoC code to no longer
use the private dma interfaces that are standing in the way of
multiplatform enablement.

However, in 313367e7bfa "ASoC: Samsung: Update Kconfig for I2S,SPDIF
and PCM audio", two new users of that interface appeared, since it
is now possible to enable SND_SOC_SAMSUNG_SMDK_SPDIF and
SND_SOC_SMDK_WM8994_PCM on all Samsung SoCs including EXYNOS.

This patch does a partial revert of 313367e7bfa by allowing these
drivers on all samsung platforms except EXYNOS, so we can proceed
with the multiplatform patches.

If support for these drivers is actually needed on EXYNOS machines,
the drivers should first be moved over to use the dmaengine code.
