Yes, none of them are needed for DT-based systems.

Let's start with a quick introduction to the s3c-pwm hardware. Each 
channel has its own timer value, compare and reload value registers, so 
they don't need any extra locking. However there are additional shared 
configuration registers, containing things such as start and reload bits 
for all channels, prescaler and main divisor values, etc. Those registers 
needs synchronization.

Now there are several possible approaches:

1) A brute force one - two separate drivers, based on the fact that the
   clocksource driver will be used only on uniprocessor systems, so
   a simple _irqsave when accessing a shared register in both will 
   guarantee correct synchronization.

2) Two separate drivers with some synchronized shared code accessing 
   registers (_start, _stop, _set_reload, _set_prescaler, _set_divisor, 
   etc.; all using a shared spinlock).

3) Single driver registering PWM channels, clocksource and clock event 
   device. This does not seem like a bad idea, since the whole code for 
   configuration of the PWM block would reside in one location and there 
   would be no redundancy. However there is a question where such driver 
   should be placed - drivers/clocksource, drivers/pwm, or maybe somewhere 
   else?

Personally I wanted to go with first option, which would require least 
amount of changes to existing code, at a cost of some code duplication 
(but some PWM code is duplicated already).

Best regards,
Tomasz
