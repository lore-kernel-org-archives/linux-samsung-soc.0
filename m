That's when the child as no other connection at all. I don't think it makes 
sense to mix description of connections through parent/child relationships and 
through ports for a single device.

And that being said, I don't agree with Rob's comment there. Having two 
different methods to describe connections means that you have to implement 
them both in all display controller drivers (and even all bridge drivers in 
the case of chained bridges). That's an extra complexity that can easily be 
avoided by standardizing DT bindings.

I also wonder whether Rob's position hasn't been reconsidered since then; I 
vaguely recalled another more recent discussion on this topic. I'm a bit too 
busy now to try and dig it up now I'm afraid :-/
