I agree with Tomasz.

Creating a custom clock type is the way to go here. It is possible to
wrap the mux clk_ops to re-use that code, or just write a custom clock
type from scratch.

I do not like using the clock rate-change notifiers for this purpose.
The notifiers provide hooks to drivers that need to take care around
clock transitions. Using the notifiers from within the clock framework
indicates poor design.

This depends on what the data sheet or reference manual states. If using
a temporary parent is a property of the clock programming sequence (e.g.
to have a glitch-less transition) then that logic belongs in the clock
provider driver (i.e. a custom clock type needs to be created with this
logic).

However if using a temporary parent is not required for programming the
clock, but is instead a requirement of the clock consumer (e.g. a CPU,
or some I/O controller) then perhaps putting this logic in that driver
is the right way to go. In that case the logic could be explicit:

	clk_set_parent(clk, temp_parent);
	clk_set_rate(clk, target_rate);
	clk_set_parent(clk, target_parent);

Or it could implicit with the use of rate-change notifiers. Again the
rate-change notifiers exist for clock consumer drivers to use, so this
is OK.

I have a hunch that the right way to do this is for a custom clock type
to be created which simply calls clk_set_parent from within the clock's
.set_rate callback, but I'll wait on feedback from Chander on the needs
of his platform.

Mike
