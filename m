Ok.  The general goal of the work that Ben and me have been discussing
and initiating is to remove the amount of code duplication when
introducing support for a new SoC.  Right now, the c100 code contains a
number of copies of the 6410 code, and the 6440 code also copies a lot
from 6410.

A lot of copying was identified in things like the platform device files
(*-dev.c) and the *-clock.c files - which is why that was the starting
point.

There may also be other files up to something like sleep.S where again
much duplication is visible (see my 6440 review mail recently)

I think this is the goal, yes.  I personally don't care too much about
correct naming or correct directory name.  The most important goal is to
prevent/remove copy+paste style code and really have every function only
once, if it is the same or 99% the same on multiple SoCs.

I think currently having 3 directories: plat-samsung, plat-s3c and
plat-s5p are in the discussion.

I think at the moment we're focusing on the plat-* directories first and
try not to change everything at the same time.  I would not propose
freely renaming / moving all directories if this does not at the same
time mean that we can remove code duplication.

I think the details will be worked out while the task is being done.
The actual base addresses for each integrated peripheral will be
provided through a soc-specific table that is passed to the platform
device handling code that ben is working on.

I think it is best to first wait for those changes to appear on the
24xx/6410 code in mainline.  We are working with System LSI to add the
6440.  Once that has been implemented and is known to work in next-s3c,
I think you can adapt your code and e.g. remove some code from
s5pc100-clock.c

So for right now, I would recommend to be a bit patient until the core
changes have emerged and stabilized, to avoid wasting your time to
change to a moving target.
