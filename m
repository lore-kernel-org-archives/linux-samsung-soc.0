Well, these are the tracepoints in question:

trace_power_start(), trace_cpu_idle(), and trace_power_end()

But this is only used by powertop, and I'm sure nobody would mind if you
rip these tracepoints out, causing powertop to no longer work. (that's
why we have 4 bytes per tracepoint wasting space in every trace event).

Anyway, one answer is (and I was talking with Paul about this on IRC) is
that we can create a special "TRACE_EVENT_IDLE()" that will explicitly
call "rcu_idle_exit/enter()" as it expects to be called with it off.

This should solve most issues I believe.
