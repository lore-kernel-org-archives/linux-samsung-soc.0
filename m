Ok.
FIMD is a display controller that reads RGB data and conveys the data
to the screen.
FIMC performs various functions including storing camera censor data to
the memory, image post processing like scaling, color space conversion
and rotation and conveying the processed data to FIMD.

I think I have explained what the quotation actually intended.
Exynos System MMUs in a SoC have the same view of physical address space.
But they provide different views of memory to their master H/Ws.
I think this is what Marek wanted to say.

Yes it is IOMMU in Exynos SoCs.
It is referred as "SysMMU", "sysmmu", "smmu" or "System MMU".
All are the same in the context of Exynos SoCs.

It is not an implementation of ARM System MMU specifications.

Definitely I agree with you.
However, this discussion is not started from Marek's comment that
several System MMUs can be attached to the same page table
It actually means:
 -> providing the same virtual address space to their master H/W
 -> ** The master H/Ws are attached to the same iommu domain. **
