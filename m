That was the initial approach.

To my understanding, Rafael's primary reason for not accepting that
was that it's not common, but it's platform-specific.

Now, even if we would reconsider doing as you propose, what would the
actual benefit be? Obviously, we would get less amount of code to
maintain, which is one reason, but are there more?

Isn't that exactly what I implemented in [1], what am I missing?

I haven't heard about this kind of issues, but I think your approach
seems reasonable.

Currently, I think we should focus on solving the problem in [1].
Those drivers/subsystems that use pm_runtime_set_active() during
->probe() are broken in this regards.

Now, if we move the attachment of devices to their PM domains from
buses into driver core, that could simplify [1]. Still, only if we
also decide to power on PM domains from driver core, else it wouldn't
matter much I think.
