It needs platform maintainers to be motivated to fix it, and one way to
provide that motivation is for subsystem maintainers to say no to patches
like this.  If patches like this get accepted, then the "problem" gets
solved, and there is very little motivation to fix the platform itself.

If you look back at the history of this, the times when platforms have
been fixed is when they have a problem exactly like this, and they're
told to fix their platforms IRQ numbering instead of the patch to "fix"
the driver being accepted.

Why fix the interrupt numbering if patches to "fix" drivers get
accepted?
