+CC Marek,

Trats2 is working with U-Boot. Just U-Boot. However I never converted S3
into Trats2 on my own. I always used targets prepared to be "Trats2"
type. 

Of course kernel is independent to bootloader but in that case you want
to use a specific interface between kernel and specific bootloader
type/version. In that case - this should be U-Boot, I think.

It would be useful to mention that in commit msg (just the source)...
however as I wrote above, these values should be for U-Boot, not the
stock one.
