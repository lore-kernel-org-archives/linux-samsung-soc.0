This patch series migrates exynos cpufreq support to use generic
cpufreq drivers. For this, cpu clock blocks are encapsulated into a
cpu clock type and cpufreq driver operates the cpu clock type.

We had discussed in the [1] about using coordinated clocks. This
series is not using the concept of coordinated clocks but the code in
this series can be migrated to use coordinated clocks when it is
available.

Is it okay to consider this series for v3.17-rc1. I will update this
code to use coordinated clocks when it is available. This series helps
with cpufreq support for newer Exynos SoCs such as Exynos5420/3250.
