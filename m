Ulf: I still haven't heard anything for Jaehoon.  Do you have any
interest in landing this series directly to your tree?  I think the
whole series has been reviewed by Shawn.  I'm happy to re-post with
collected tags or anything else you'd like.  It would be nice to get
the regression fixed sooner rather than later...

Thanks!  :)
