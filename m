I would wait with applying any patches from this series until they are 
acked by crypto subsystem maintainer and DT bindings by DT maintainers.

I'd like Naveen to resend this series in separate thread, with proper 
message threading, so we can make sure that we are not missing anything. 
Naveen, please also add

David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>

to Cc list, as he is also listed as crypto maintainer in MAINTAINERS file.

Best regards,
Tomasz
