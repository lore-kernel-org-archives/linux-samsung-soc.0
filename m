Yes the driver nodes should describe in DT which pins to use:

        serial@12340000 {
                compatible = "8250";
                reg = <0x12340000 0x40>;
                reg-shift = <2>;
                interrupts = < 10 >;
		pins = "uart1_rx", "uart1_tx";
        };

Note that we should use the actual signal names, not package specific
pad names. This way they have a high likelyhood to work for new packages
too by just mapping the signals to the new package.

I think things like above should also be set in the node for the
driver because it is board specific. For example, if you have an
external pull on the board for some line, then the internal pull
needs to be disabled.

I don't know how we should describe the driver set values though,
maybe something like:

        serial@12340000 {
                compatible = "8250";
                reg = <0x12340000 0x40>;
                reg-shift = <2>;
                interrupts = < 10 >;
		pins = "uart1_rx", "uart1_tx";
		pin-values = < 0x7 0x7 >;
	};

Note that with device tree things get simpler for muxing as we can
get rid of the hardcoded grouping of pins in mux drivers. Instead of
hardcoded pingroups, the groups can be created dynamically based on
what the driver DT entries have.

The reason why we want to avoid hardcoded pin groups is because trying
to map all the pad combinations in the pinmux driver is not a scalable
way to go. And it's not even possible at least on omaps because of the
huge number of combinations with alternative pins and multiple packages.

FYI I'm playing with a DT based pinmux-simple.c driver that should
be pretty generic and work for all kinds of hardware hopefully.

It will be few days before I can post anything though, there are
some pinctrl fwk issues to deal with first. Like the hardcoded
pinmux_maps that assumes that dev entries are static. This means
that multiple instances of pinmux drivers won't work..

Cheers,

Tony
