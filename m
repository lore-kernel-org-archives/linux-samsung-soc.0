Ok, then I guess the translation is actually not at fault here but something
else. I would recommend looking at the IOMMU as the potential culprit. Maybe
having it disabled means that no DMA is going through, rather than all DMA
going through untranslated. Another possibility is that the IOMMU is set up
so that when disabled, it maps DMA address 0 to the start of RAM, rather
than identity mapping DMA address 0x80000000 there. If that's the case,
you either have to use the IOMMU, or set up the mapping in the root
complex to revert it.
