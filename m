if I understand things right (thanks to Russell), the Power domain may =
not
 be powered off not only in above case, but also in some cases when
driver is unloaded.

AMBA bus for example:
static int amba_remove(struct device *dev)
{
	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev); <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is active, usage_c=
ount >=3D 1
	ret =3D drv->remove(pcdev); <----------- GPD=3Don, should do balancing=
 put() to compensate all get() made by driver, usage_count =3D=3D 1
				  <----------- GPD=3Don, should do balancing get() to compensate pu=
t() in probe, usage_count =3D=3D 2
	pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev); <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is active, usage=
_count =3D=3D 1

	/* Undo the runtime PM settings in amba_probe() */
	pm_runtime_disable(dev);  <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is active, usage_c=
ount =3D=3D 1
	pm_runtime_set_suspended(dev); <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is suspended,=
 usage_count =3D=3D 1
	pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev); <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is suspended, us=
age_count =3D=3D 0

	amba_put_disable_pclk(pcdev);
	dev_pm_domain_detach(dev, true); <---------- GPD=3Don, dev is suspende=
d, usage_count =3D=3D 0

also:
 i2c-qup.c
 i2c-hix5hd2.c
 exynos_drm_gsc.c
 exynos_drm_fimc.c
 ab8500-gpadc.c
 ...

Is it?
