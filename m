I know the basics of media controller, but I haven't really looked at
the code.

I can't say if MC should be used for fb or not, but I think something
similar should be used if we want to get overlays etc. supported. But
even with MC (or something else) there, I'm not quite sure how they fit
into the fb model.

I think the core problem here is that in a more complex setup (at least
as I see it for OMAP) the fb should be just a framebuffer in memory,
without any direct relation to hardware. The hardware part (an overlay,
or whichever is the corresponding element) will then use the framebuffer
as the pixel source.

However, the current fb model combines those two things into one. If we
manage to separate them, and add MC or similar, I think it'll work.

Do you mean how the hardware works, or how I've designed omapfb driver?

Right, I think you're pondering the core problem here =).

On OMAP we have the display (the whole area shown on the panel/tv),
which has video timings and things like that. But no pixel data as such
(a configurable background color is there, though).

And then we have the overlays, which are somewhere on the display, and
the overlays get pixel data from memory (framebuffers).

So in a way we have a contentless root window, but presenting that with
an fb device doesn't feel right. And the fb device would logically be
fb0, and if it couldn't show any content it couldn't be used as default
framebuffer.

Yes, free z-order is supported in OMAP4. Previous OMAPs had fixed
z-order, although in certain configuration (enable/disable alpha
blending) the fixed z-order does change...

For a system where there's always a root window for every output, plus
variable size overlays, FB_CAP_NOTIMING makes sense. But it would still
leave the problem if there's no root window. How to change timings on a
system like OMAP?
