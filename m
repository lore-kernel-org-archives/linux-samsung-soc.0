I think we should call this infrastructure vfio for "platform
devices".  These devices are on a platform bus, as can be seen 
in /sys/bus/platform.  It is conceivable that there are platform
devices not in a device tree.

Also, the term "device tree devices" just seems awkward.

Yes, we really need to solve this.  I need to get more familiar with
the platform device infrastructure in Linux, but it seems at a high level
that it shouldn't be that hard to support dynamic binding.  We have
device drivers that register to handle certain "compatible"
strings.  And we have device tree parsing code that does platform_device_add()
calls to associate/bind a device to a driver.

What we need is something like the "new_id" mechanism in PCI where we
can have a platform driver dynamically register to support a new
device type.

Also, note that any Linux driver needs to properly support 'unbinding'
as well.   We can't have the normal driver and vfio competing to
bind to the same device.

I would suggest adding a patch to this series that updates Documentation/vfio.txt
with any platform device specifics.

For example, it should be stated explicitly that if a device has multiple
regions and multiple IRQs that the "index" exposed by VFIO is the same
as the index within the associated "reg" and "interrupt" properties
in the device tree representation.

.i.e. if a device is represented like this in the device tree:

        reg = <0x101e2000 0x1000 0x101e4000 0x1000>;
        interrupts = <24 25 26 27>;

region #0 is 0x101e2000, region #1 is 0x101e4000
interrupt #0 is 24, and so on.

Perhaps that seems obvious, but think it is good to state it
explicitly in Documentation/vfio.txt.

would prefer:
