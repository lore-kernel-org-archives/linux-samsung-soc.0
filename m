This makes me sad. I was responsible for its introduction, and my motive
was exactly yours in sending the above.

The problem I saw was functions returning -ERRORs or NULL. There were
too many, and there was too much sloppy code inconsistently handling one
or either of the two, and not always both. I did consider trying to fix
some of the core functions that were returning -ERRORs or NULL to the
drivers I was involved in, but it seemed like there were too many, and
that would be too "brave". I imagined that my macro would help catch
that undesirable situation, and permit people to map the error onto
whatever was most appropriate to propagate on.

The idea of them propagating the undesirable problem up further in the call
chain is the exact antithesis of what I intended.

Thank you for highlighting the issue I didn't foresee (neither did my 
colleagues at Nokia, they made good use of it fairly quickly) and in 
such unambiguous terms. Better to nip it in the bud, certainly.

:-(

So, what to do? It can and has been used sensibly, so I don't think removing
it is the best option.
