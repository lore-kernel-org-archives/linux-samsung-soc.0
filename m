This is how the power controller works on exynos5410. For example for CORE0.

ARM_CORE0_STATUS register indicates the power state of Core 0 part of 
processor core.
0x3 indicates that power to Core 0 is turned-on. 0x0 indicates that 
power to Core 0 is turned-off.
All other values indicate that the power On/Off sequence of Core 0 in 
progress.

To turn Off the power of Core 0 power domain:

1. Set the LOCAL_POWER_CFG field of ARM_CORE0_CONFIGURATION register to 0x3.
2. After PMU detects a change in the LOCAL_POWER_CFG field, it waits for 
the execution of WFI.
3. After Core 0 executes the WFI instruction, PMU starts the power-down 
sequence.
4. The Status field of ARM_CORE0_STATUS register indicates the 
completion of the sequence.

That's why in the v1 of this patch exynos_core_power_control function 
was implemented as:

static int exynos_core_power_control(unsigned int cpu, unsigned int 
cluster,  int enable)
{
        unsigned long timeout = jiffies + msecs_to_jiffies(10);
        unsigned int offset = cluster * MAX_CPUS_PER_CLUSTER + cpu;
        int value = enable ? S5P_CORE_LOCAL_PWR_EN : 0;

        if ((__raw_readl(EXYNOS5410_CORE_STATUS(offset)) & 0x3) == value)
                return 0;

        __raw_writel(value, EXYNOS5410_CORE_CONFIGURATION(offset));
        do {
                if ((__raw_readl(EXYNOS5410_CORE_STATUS(offset)) & 0x3)
                                == value)
                        return 0;
        } while (time_before(jiffies, timeout));

        return -EDEADLK;
}

But, as i mentioned, this is no good using while here.
Now thinking about the problem.

Thank you,
