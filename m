Laura,

Here is my assessment of the current situation.

*Bug in the u-boot*
Current u-boot for Arndale-octa board has defined NR_BANKS as 12 and the
core uses a global structure (gd->bd) to maintain the start and size of
individual banks. Depending on the revision of SoC used on the board,
the board file [1] updates the start/size for either 8 or 12 banks. In
case of current revision of Arndale-Octa boards, the board file always
updates start/size for 8 banks, leaving the start/size data for
remaining 4 banks uninitialized.

But the u-boot core[2] updates the value of all the 12 banks, thus
potentially updating invalid data for last 4 banks.

The issue can be fixed by resetting the start/size for unused memory
banks to 0/0.[3]

*Before migration to memblock*
The path for adding DRAM banks was done through [4]. For Exynos systems,
NR_BANKS was defined as 8. The initial check for rejecting any banks
beyond NR_BANKS was good enough for fixing this issue. The bootlog[5]
(with some debug messages) shows the invalid data, both in u-boot and
kernel. Please grep for "NR_BANKS too low, ignoring memory" in the bootlog.

*After migration to memblock*
Now that the memory banks are added through [6], all the memory banks
are getting updated unconditionally resulting in the panic.

IMO, the bug is in u-boot and we should fix that.
