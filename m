It wasn't sanity checking the values (there is some sanity checking,
but the sanity checking doesn't catch this).

What caught it was that the kernel was configured to only look at the
first 8 of the 12 meminfo entries with ATAGs.  Since we no longer have
that limit, all meminfo entries are now looked at (since the kernel
doesn't need the limit.)

We could add back a soft-limit on the number of meminfo entries, but
this has to be platform specific.  Another entry to go into the
mach_info structures?
