I agreee here


as example on at91 I try to found a good way to let the macb driver to ask the
pin configuration

so in my mind i do not need put all pins in each board but in the dtsi and
then in the drivers just said
	pins = "mii";
	or
	pins = "rmii";
	or if I want to use the alternative config

	pins = "mii_alt";
	or
	pins = "rmii_alt";

and then in the dtsi I describe the  pin used for those configs
which is soc specifific not board

Best Regards,
J.
