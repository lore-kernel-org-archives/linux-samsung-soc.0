My apologies for not replying earlier, I got distracted by other 
activities.

I'd prefer not adding anything new to the PM core, however there are
dependencies between the power domain and clock controller driver 
which are hard to model in the current APIs.  I assume resorting to 
inter-exynos-driver API is not a good idea either.

Saving/restoring the clock hierarchy in the clock controller driver
during the power domain state transitions has a caveat that the clock
turn off/on sequences are IP/SoC subsystem specific.  So simply 
restoring saved registers from memory is not going to work.

The other detail I might have forgotten to mention is that the whole
clock controller may be in same power domain as the consumer devices.
That means the clock controller's registers must not be touched when
a related power domain is turned off.  Naturally when a power domain 
gets switched off all the clock controller's registers reset to their 
default values.  If we decided to use pm_runtime_{get_sync, put} in
the clock controller driver I'm not sure how it would need to interact
with the clk API.
In current mainline there is an issue with exynos4x12 that the system
may hang if clk_summary is attempted to read as the clock controller
driver doesn't take the ISP power domain into account.

I was concerned that it would not have been reliable by using the clk 
API due to the clk enable refcounting.  But that might not be a valid 
argument, since as you pointed out when a power domain is about to 
be gated related the clocks should be already disabled.

The other concern was atomicity in enabling/disabling groups of clocks,
i.e. setting group of bits in a clock gate register at once, rather
than a bit for each clock one by one.  But I'm not 100% sure about 
such a hardware requirement myself, would need to do some more testing 
and/or find a hardware engineer who could explain this. 

Additionally specifying clocks in device tree would be a bit messy and
there would very likely anyway be an additional information required 
in the power domain driver per each power domain regarding the clock 
handling sequence.
