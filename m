Ok, i will clear on this with the hardware engineer also once.
May be Jingoo can help me with this.

Jingoo,
Can you please enquire about the clock path of usbphy30 reference
clocks on Exynos5420.
As mentioned by Tomasz above, we have sclk_usbphy300 and
sclk_usbphy301 as the reference clocks for USB3.0 DRD phy. *Also*
sclk_usbphy300 is used for Pico phy (which is the USb 2.0 phy used by
ehci/ohci controller on Exynos5420).
It will be of great help.


Thanks
Vivek
