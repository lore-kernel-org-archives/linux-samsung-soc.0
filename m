Thanks for your feedback.

I now took a look at the kernel code Odroid provides, especially the ACE crypto driver.
It's a 3.10.82 kernel with a lot of Samsung code which is not (yet) upstreamed.

There seem to be different revisions of SSS (ACE driver mentions v.4, v.5, v.6, and Slim SSS).
The vendor kernel uses Slim SSS and the HW AES encryption works.
The code there looks like Exynos 5422 should support also v.5, but it's disabled.

I didn't test all SSS registers but for the ones I tested I can change the value.
Having said that access to SSS registers is not forbidden.

Then I changed the memory mapped region to 0x10900000, offset 0x800. According to the
vendor kernel code there should be the registers for hash functions under Slim SSS.

Not much luck either .. Maybe because Slim SSS uses another clock.
The Slim SSS clock is defined in include/dt-bindings/clock/exynos5420.h already.
I added a clock definition based on the one in the vendor kernel and changed the DT node to use it.

        GATE(CLK_SSS, "sss", "aclk266_g2d", GATE_IP_G2D, 2, 0, 0),
+       GATE(CLK_SLIM_SSS, "slimsss", "aclk266_g2d", GATE_IP_G2D, 12, 0, 0),

But this didn't do the trick yet.
