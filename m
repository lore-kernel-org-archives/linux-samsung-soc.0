Then we should encourage as many developers as possible to share their
private tests with us.

There was a similar discussion with device tree and finally it was
included in the mainline repository.

It is hard for me to agree on this issue.

Performance assures that we will have the right frequency set.

However, there can be a similar patch to use userspace governor and
various load to fail if ondemand's frequency flipping is detected.

Sometimes "interresting" things show up when you have 100% CPU load and
you try to switch frequency.
In my opinion usage of gzip makes the test more difficult to pass.

Ok. Lets wait for Rafael's opinion.

It is one possible solution, where another one is to run the all scripts
in the directory.

I'm curious about Rafael's opinion.
