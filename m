Beware.. exynos_core_power_up() is called with a lock held.

There is no need for the CPU going down to check the PMU status.  It can 
only have one state at that point.

Exact.

Does it matter?  As you say ...

This is not the case on TC2 it seems.  We never check if a power-down 
sequence has completed before issuing a power-up request.  Given each 
CPU has its own request bit then this might not matter.

Where this matters is when you really want to ensure a given CPU is not 
executing code anymore and therefore need to know when power-down has 
effectively completed, hence the power_down_finish method.
