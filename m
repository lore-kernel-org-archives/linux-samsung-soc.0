Yes, indeed. I forgot to add that details.

Okay, seems more accurate.

Some of them are broken, some not. :) Buck 1-4 and 6 also should have
minimal selector. Also number of selectors and masks seems to be
invalid. I already have a plan to fix this up but it is not an urgent
task because the driver works so far.

Thanks!

I'll update patch as you suggested and re-spin with tags.

Best regards,
