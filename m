Hi,

Rebased on v4.18-rc2, because at v4.18-rc1 the NFS root boot, which I use at my
testing setup (https://krzk.eu), was broken.

Best regards,
Krzysztof

  usb: host: exynos: Remove support for Exynos5440 (2018-07-24 18:44:00 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Exynos5440 drivers removal

The Exynos5440 (quad-core A15 with GMAC, PCIe, SATA) was targeting
server platforms but it did not make it to the market really.  There are
no development boards with it and probably there are no real products
neither.  The development for Exynos5440 ended in 2013 and since then
the platform is in maintenance mode.

Removing Exynos5440 makes our life slightly easier: less maintenance,
smaller code, reduced number of quirks, no need to preserve DTB
backward-compatibility.

The Device Tree sources and some of the drivers for Exynos5440 were
already removed.  This removes remaining drivers.
