The same can be true for device tree based drivers. We should tell user space which device tree node this is based off of so it can go and find properties itself, similar to how a kernel driver can still read dt properties for a platform device. But this is optional - we could just as well give user space a hint on an acpi interface.

What exactly would you consider not abstracted information that the kernel driver would need to know about? All cases I can think of (reset logic, power constraints) are very device specific and would require a new vfio-dt-mydevice driver on top of your generic framework to handle these small device specific bits.
