The code isn't in for-next because we're in a merge window, and
linux-next is supposed to be stable for the duration of that, only
accepting bug fixes.

It was added briefly to for-next (carefully timed and discussed
with Stephen to ensure it didn't appear in linux-next), to try
and get fuller builder coverage, which is when the above issue was
found.

If you want to test, please use its separate branch, 'spectre'.
Thanks.
