Thanks!

Yes, that's why I said "maybe" :)

hrmm I don't know, I think this issue happens with any DRM driver. Hopefully
there should be soon a nice hand off from simplefb to DRM drivers like early
console does to the real console drivers for UARTs.

Yeah and in fact this does not happen with the stock bootloader that comes
shipped on these devices, is with a special build that has this hack enabled.
