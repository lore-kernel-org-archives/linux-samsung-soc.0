Generally, there are two or even three levels of runtime PM handling,
driver, (possibly) bus type and (possibly) PM domain (and multiple levels
of these are possible in principle).  All of them have to be initialized
at different times.

Quite arguably, the PM domain and/or bus type runtime PM handling should
be initialized even before registerind the device or during device
registration.  Doing that later may be too late.  When the device has been
registered, runtime PM should work to an extent allowing the driver to access
the device and configure it further after calling pm_runtime_resume().

Of course, if ->probe() is to call pm_runtime_resume() for this purpose,
it must take the fact that the driver's own ->runtime_resume() may be called
as a result of this into account.  That's why I'm asking whether or not the
core should call pm_runtime_resume() before calling really_probe() in a
followup branch of this thread.

The driver's own runtime PM handling must be initialized in the driver and
the only place suitable for that is ->probe().  However, it needs to be done
*before* the driver's own ->runtime_resume() or ->runtime_suspend() callback
is executed.  If that is done properly, it should be possible to cover
both the CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set/unset cases in that code.

And I wouldn't recommend anyone to do the runtime PM initialization in
->runtime_resume() (when it is called for the first time), as that would be
error prone and fragile.

I think, however, that it might work if the core calls pm_runtime_get_sync()
from driver_probe_device().

That is quite simple to address, though.  You can register a bus type
notifier that will power up the domain on BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE events
(where the target device belongs to the domain), and do that only for
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset (otherwise runtime PM should take care of this).

OK

It looks like we need an agreement on what to do and what the expectations
should be for each driver core operation at the high level.  That is,
what ->probe() should expect, what ->remove() should expect, what the
state after executing each of them should be for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set and
unset etc.  Otherwise we'll always have various bus types doing what *they*
think is appropriate and not agreeing with each other.
