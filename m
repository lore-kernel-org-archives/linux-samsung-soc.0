I believe we could postpone it to probe time, but I'd rather not.
The way I see the arguments in favor, we have mainly cosmetic arguments:

- Doing it at probe time would eliminate the ugly section magic hack
- iommu drivers could be implemented as loadable modules with platform
  drivers, for consistency with most other drivers

On the other hand, I see:

- DMA configuration is traditionally done at device creation time, and
  changing that is more likely to introduce bugs than leaving it
  where it is.
- On a lot of machines, the IOMMU is optional, and the probe function
  cannot know the difference between an IOMMU driver that is left out
  of the kernel and one that will be initialized later, using a fixed
  entry point for initializing the IOMMU makes the behavior consistent

There is a third option in theory, which is to only enable the IOMMU
as part of dma_set_mask(). I've done that in the past on powerpc, but
the new approach seems cleaner.
