okay.

The host capability 'polling' seems to be more of board dependent
property than controller property. This property changes the way the
host stack detects the presence of the card. Some boards might have
broken card detection logic. So 'polling' cannot be generalized as a
controller property. Each host controller instance in a SoC would have
to be told if its card detection is broken. This is done currently
using the platform data.

Similarly, the host property 'disable' depends on the board. The
controller would be capable of handling the 'disable' feature but on
some boards, disabling to save power during idle times might not work
since the device connected to that host might have issues by doing so.
On a SoC with multiple host controllers, some controllers would want
to use 'disable' feature and others might not. So, 'disable' would
have to be board specific.

Okay. I agree with your viewpoint. I will try to redo this again.
Unfortunately, host controller drivers have used platform data to feed
host controller capabilities directly from platform code to the mmc
stack. And more and more of such changes are still being made. I will
attempt another version of this patch based on yours, Olof's and Rob's
comments.

Thanks Grant for your comments.

Regards,
Thomas.
