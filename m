I'd argue about relevance of this example. What I'm talking about is 
kind of data that can be retrieved directly from the hardware. Both 
compatible string and board number are just artificial identifiers that 
can be used by the kernel to decide (in a greatly simplified view) which 
set of static (i.e. hardcoded) data (and code) to use.

If it happens that a new piece of hardware requires just exactly the 
same set, because any possible differences can be obtained by reading 
some registers, then there is no need for the kernel to support any new 
compatible string and such hardware will work on older kernels as well.

I don't mind fine grained compatible strings. In fact, making them fine 
grained is most likely to be the best choice most of the time. Still, 
the simple fact is, though, that data which can be retrieved from the 
hardware automatically should not be repeated in DT. This is called 
redundancy and this is bad, from obvious reasons.

My proposal was about simply adding a fully generic string, without 
removing the specific ones. For already supported SoCs this is pretty 
obvious, as existing DTBs would not have this generic string listed. But 
the specific strings should be also present in DTSes of new SoCs, even 
if not recognized by the kernel, to make sure that in future any 
SoC-specific quirks could be easily handled.

I fully agree. As I said, after cleaning up mach-exynos/ there should be 
no more code left using soc_is_*() macros. Ideally, the whole 
mach-exynos/ should collapse into a single, trivial file, with 
everything done in dedicated drivers.

This would let you detect the problem earlier, though, without trying to 
probe incorrect devices and activating unsuitable configurations on 
devices that may happen to match on both SoCs. I agree, though, that 
this is not anything essential.
