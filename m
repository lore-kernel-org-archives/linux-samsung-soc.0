I would put it different way: The binding should provide information 
detailed enough to allow any features allowed by Linux software design.

Well, anyway, I don't believe that existing, pre-ARM, bindings wasn't 
influenced by how things worked on PowerPC platforms and software running 
on them (including OpenFirmware and OS'es like Linux).

Isn't a binding of particular device free to define a private property? 
Anyway, I wouldn't be opposed to making it generic.

That's why this property is optional. If you don't know how this is set up 
on your hardware then you don't fill it with a random value, but just skip 
it instead.

Adding a node with a new interrupt usually means adding support for new 
hardware. This is something I wouldn't really want to see submitted 
untested...

Anyway, since I'd like this series to be merged ASAP and this patch is not 
strictly necessary, especially this optional sanity check, let me just 
drop this property and move on with other things...

Best regards,
Tomasz
