This looks to me like masking a bug somewhere else. I don't think this 
is a good idea, because such bug forgotten may strike again later with 
worse and hard to debug effects. I'd insist on fixing it instead.

Well, you have not addressed the comment about using generic fixed rate 
clock bindings. The old vendor-specific bindings are deprecated and must 
not be used anymore by new code. Please fix it.

I'll see how v4 looks, though.
