That's different.  The iPaq had very little in terms of firmware, and 
the one it had was field upgradable with almost no risk to brick it 
(unless you wanted to hack the firmware code but that's another story).  
The reason iPaq had never been well supported in mainline can be 
attributed to laziness for not wanting to make the code into a shape 
acceptable for mainline inclusion.  But nothing fundamentally prevented 
that from happening if someone had wanted to do it.

Here we're talking about firmware-induced hacks for which, had there 
been no firmware, the kernel would be in full position to fix properly 
because that would have been a kernel bug after all.

Hence my crusade against this "you should abstract things in firmware" 
mantra. Especially for mobile devices.

But, because firmware already exists out there and it is between 
prohibitive and impossible to fix, we have no choice but to compensate 
in the kernel some times.  In this very case my approach is to render 
the firmware irrelevant globally rather than trying to work around it 
for one particular device.
