Why will you not have that pointer?  You can't rely on the "name" as the
device id will not match up, so you should be able to rely on the
pointer being in the structure that the board sets up, right?

Don't use names, especially as ids can, and will, change, that is going
to cause big problems.  Use pointers, this is C, we are supposed to be
doing that :)
