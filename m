As per my knowlegde Odroid XU3/4 can throttle at much high temperature.

https://github.com/hardkernel/linux/blob/odroidxu3-3.10.y/drivers/thermal/exynos_thermal.c#L1629

The device tree binding for thermal-zone is kept bit low alert
temperature values
in-order to avoid reaches critical temperature and board shutdown
when compiling the source code. We need t fix this thermal-zone

Their could be some race in thermal or the step wise governor for
exynos is not working correctly.

Better option is to print the cpufreq for cpu0 and cpu4 and respective temp
and plot a graph along timeline. It will give us clear idea on how much
time is spend on high frequency on stress testing.

#!/bin/bash
t=0
while true :
do
 a=`cat /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`
 b=`cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`
 c=`cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq`
 d=`cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq`
 e=`cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu4/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq`
 (( t += 5 ))
 echo $t,$a,$b,$d,$e
 sleep 1
done
