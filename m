It is very important to model when resources are not needed, since this
has some system-wide effects. There are two main use-cases I have in
mind:

1) MMC clk is a leaf clock of some complex hierarchy (e.g. a PLL at the
top of a clock sub-tree). If MMC is always "locked" at some fast rate
(e.g. 48MHz instead of 24MHz or 12MHz) then that constraint prevents
the rest of the hierarchy from transitioning to a lower frequency. Even
if the MMC clock is aggressively gating, maximum system-level power
savings may not be achieved since the rest of the clock sub-tree
(starting at the PLL) will be "stuck" at a higher frequency than
necessary. Thus, aggressive clock gating might give good power savings
for the MMC case, but may be a blocker for other system components.

2) Wake-up latency constraints might make it impossible to clock gate,
and thus the only power-saving option is to run at a lower frequency.
This is not quite what is described above, but the point is that clock
frequency scaling and clock gating are complementary power saving
options, but we rely on the driver to model resource requirements
accurately to get the best results.

Mike
