Can you suggest how to break it up ?

It is now big update, added working functionallity in one piece,
but I agree it can be hard to read
as git did some strange things,
like delete few aes functions (and mixing this delete with '+' lines)
and then adding the same aes without any change.

What cleanups do you see ? 
You mean this one "#if 0" ?

You are right, I will remove it.

The problem is in dts there are described
only AES registers (the range is too small),
and HASH and PRNG uses the same HASH_CONTROL_1 register 
(setting SecSS engine).
Both AES and HASH must use FC control registers for irq
and flow setting.

So this 'hack' prevents using both exynos-prng and s5p-sss HASH,
and in presence of exynos-prng it will load only s5p-sss aes part.

This will disable exynos-prng in scenario:

remove exynos-prng
remove s5p-sss
load s5p-sss

now exynos-prng module will not load.
