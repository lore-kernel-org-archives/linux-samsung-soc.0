I don't think that need warning to it, because it is not wrong being NULL.

If stat != NULL, I think that it does not need...because should being reg.

Generally, the meaning of stable value may not change....frankly I'm not sure...
but if change, then we can add that later...so right now, unnecessary stuff like that does not need.

Then...and no need to add 'struct clkstat_reg'
