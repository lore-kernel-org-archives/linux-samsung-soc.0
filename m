The device has four power input lines (called VBAT, VDD33, VDD_CORE and
VDD_12). Datasheet describes 4 valid configurations... but impression of
the Odroid U3 board schematics is that they used another (custom?)
configuration.

I did not add rest of regulators on purpose:
1. I don't have other configurations to test.
2. It is rather old device, so I don't expect active development.

The VDD33 is really optional. The device can work in different
configuration, e.g. only on VBAT. How the reset logic would work then? I
don't know... I would suspect that it could be exactly the same (just
replace VDD33 with VBAT) but I am not sure.

I double checked the code and there might be in-balance if DT or
platform data sets initial mode to suspend. Otherwise it should be balanced.

I'll re-think the patch and fix this.

I must admit I wasn't sure about handling the ENODEV and some other
examples (drivers) were handling this just like that.

Thanks for pointing this out.

Okay.

Thanks for feedback!

Best regards,
