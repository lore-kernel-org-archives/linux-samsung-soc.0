Maybe you guys have already got this all figured out -- if so, feel 
free to ignore this email.

Some subsystems handle this issue by calling pm_runtime_get_sync() 
before probing a driver and pm_runtime_put_sync() after unbinding the 
driver.  If the driver is runtime-PM-enabled, it then does its own 
put_sync near the end of its probe routine and get_sync in its release 
routine.

With PHYs you don't have probing and releasing, but you do have 
consumers registering and unregistering themselves, which is about the 
same thing.
