Sorry to jump in late here, but I wasn't aware of this thread.

I don't necessarily agree with that. Describing the HW doesn't necessarily
mean that each device needs to describe what pinmux pins it uses; one
could quite easily have the pinmux describe what settings the various
pins should have and which drivers will use those pins. That would map
very well to the pinctrl subsystem's mapping table, and at least Tegra's
existing pinmux tables, which are both just a big array of settings which
end up getting provided to drivers.

I'll try and track down the rest of this thread and catch up though...
