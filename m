Read the thread again.
Nobody is claiming the copyright, it rests with Samsung as before.

Kukjin thinks merging two files is a serious enough change to
warrant co-authorship, which I disagree.
(The line below 'Copyright' tells the author, and its email, of the file).

Please check, it is there indeed.

Equally objectionable is any tom, dick or harry claiming co-authorship
of a code(f3.c) that is almost an equivalent of  'cat f1.c f2.c > f3.c'

I am equally pissed off by the fact that Kukjin/Boojin sneaked in the
co-authorship in this revision while carrying over the Acked-by's from
previous revision as if it has already been approved by others.
