I disagree. The "correct representation" is whatever the devicetree binding
documentation describes. It does not describe placing timer nodes in the cpu
nodes.

The binding specification does not specify that there should be multiple timer
nodes, nor does it specify that they should be under cpu nodes. The timers,
being a banked resource, can be described with one node.

It is not up to the Linux kernel to handle undocumented variations of bindings.

Sorry, I misread the diff. Your patch in fact corrects them to be consistent
where they weren't previously.

Thanks,
