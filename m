Hi,

I have observed on an average 2 failures in 100 S2R cycles even with
the mainline kernel on SMDK5420. The system resumes fine after an
aborted suspend. I have isolated the problem to the MCT_L0 interrupt.
On disabling the forwarding of just this interrupt from the
distributor there are no failures for over 1000 cycles.
Code exists to mask the system timer wake-up and post-resume in a
failed case the WAKEUP_STAT register does not show the timer having
woken up the system (I am checking this quite early post-resume).
On suspending the system, the non-boot cores would free their timer
irqs (in the MCT driver) but not the boot core. So, there is a
possibility that L0 irq might wake the system if it races with
suspend. Is this a possibility ? Please correct me if my understanding
is wrong.
