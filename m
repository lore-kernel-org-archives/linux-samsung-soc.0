Indeed, although I think there is a difference between talking about the OPMODE
field of the regulators control register (which the shift and mask refer to)
and the semantics of the value that is written (whether is an mode or an enable
pin).

But yeah, I agree the Maxim documentation is confusing and confused me too
before Mark explained to me that only two operating modes exist for this device.

You are welcome.
