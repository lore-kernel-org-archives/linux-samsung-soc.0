I definitely hope we won't have to deal with plugging non-PCI devices
into VMs. Nothing good can come out of that.

Yes, defining them in an extensible way is always a good idea, but I
think it would be better not to define the fine details until we
actually need them in this case.

Can you give an example where this would be done for a good reason?
I can't come up with an example that doesn't involve the hardware
design being seriously screwed.
