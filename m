That's not quite true, as on a single board you should rather have
a single device node with "okay" status referencing given set of pins.
Still, I think that a separate safe state is the way to go.

That's a feature of Common Clock Framework.

Maybe that's the way to do it. I need to think a bit more on this,
especially considering our (Samsung's) use cases.
