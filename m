So far it seems that device tree simplifies things here quite a bit in at
least two ways:

- We by default have automatically generated 1:1 mapping of devices to
  groups (of course others can be added too)

- We should be able to support new SoC packages with different pin on
  existing kernels, like distro kernels, just by modifying the the device
  tree data ;)

Still need few more days with these patches..

Yeah we can sort those out afterwards. We should probably pass over
the static board specific mapping as platform_data to the pinmux device
and make it be part of struct pinctrl_dev. Then new driver instances
can have their own pctldev->mapping and we can support both platform_data
and device tree based drivers on the same system. Anyways, I'll try to
get the initial patches working with just one instance to start with
so we have something to play
with.

Tony
