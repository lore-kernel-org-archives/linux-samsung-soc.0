I've just been talking to someone this week about (presumably) non-TWD
local timers.

I suspect your patch is all part of the "lets try to get ARM building
for every platform in the world in one kernel" but it's really painful
to see carefully abstracted interfaces being trodden on by this argument
- which is just going to make things more difficult in the future.
