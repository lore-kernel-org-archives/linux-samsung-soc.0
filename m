That is covered by absence of cd-gpios and broken-cd. Any *-gpios
property means the signal is a GPIO line controlled by a GPIO controller.

I suppose you could have the CD state readable via the SDHCI, but the
interrupt comes from a GPIO controller. Or vice-versa, but that's a
pretty broken use case if you can't pick which way you are going to use
things.

It seems you are mixing pin muxing and who controls/handles the CD
detect signal. Pin muxing is a separate issue and should be addressed by
pin mux bindings. Either the signal functions as a GPIO or it functions
as a CD as part of the SDHCI. You may have muxing on the CD pin that
allows it to function either way, but the DT binding should describe how
you want it to be configured and used.
