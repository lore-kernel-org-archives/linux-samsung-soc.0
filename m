Hi Chanwoo,

As you know, the arm64-exynos5433 couldn't be sent to upstream during
previous merge window because it cannot be built without other stuff
such as board DT file. I think, you need to post its regarding board DT
file, I could test the exynos5433 series in my side with smdk5433 dt
file though. Maybe as you know, I have no plan to upstream the smdk5433
DT file because it will not be used outside of Samsung S.LSI.

Thanks,
Kukjin
