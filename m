>>> Well, PPMUs and DMCs are separate hardware blocks found inside Exynos SoCs. Busfreq/devfreq is just a Linux-specific abstraction responsible for collecting data using PPMUs and controlling frequencies and voltages of appropriate power planes, vdd_int responsible for powering DMC0 and DMC1 blocks in this case.

Busfreq/devfreq is not a hardware block, but a Linux-specific driver, so it's not suitable to be described by DT directly, especially considering the fact that in future it might be replaced by or merged with another subsystem.

You means that PPMU must need separate framework from devfreq subsystem?
If PPMU framework will be implemented, PPMU framework provides API to external device driver
as common clk framework, regulator framework.
And then,exynos4 busfreq with devfreq have to use PPMU framework to monitor memory utilization.

Is this right?

For example in Exynos4412 a power plane would be VDD_ARM, containing 4 Cortex A9 cores, two L2 cache blocks, L2 cache controller, SCU, and several other blocks. Another example in Exynos4412 would be VDD_INT plane, which contains MFC, AudioSS, LCD0, ISP, TV, CAM and several other blocks.

exynos4 busfreq with devfreq must need to execute .probe().
So, exynos4 busfreq with devfreq should add dt node for exynos4 busfreq.
But,
You means that exynos4 busfreq can't add dt node of exynos4 busfreq
because this driver has not the hardware block. ?
