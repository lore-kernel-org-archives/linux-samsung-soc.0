Thank you for testing!

AFAIK Android kernel disables unused CPUs by itself.  There is also
ongoing work on Exynos coupled cpuidle driver for upstream kernels
which will handle offlining of CPUs for AFTR mode transparently to
the kernel (currently only Exynos4210 SoC is supported by the driver
posted by Daniel Lezcano, we are working on Exynos3250 SoC support
and once it is done we might try to also do Exynos4x12 SoCs version).
