At this point, focus on getting the critical portions of S5PV310/S5PC210
into
the mainline. Once that is done, other features can be merged as required.

Thanks for your concern.
But I think it's enough just only one patch about following...
I know the problem that we cannot get the proper clock 'id' from clk_get()
in
the console_initcall(). This problem occurs when only defined 'uclk1' as
uart
clock. And to solve that will be submitted soon.

I don't think so, 'gpio_to_irq' is a new feature not a bug fix.
So if required, will be merged at the merge window after review.

I couldn't find anywhere used it in the mainline. So I'm not sure we really
need it.

mm...I will sort this out.

Thanks.
