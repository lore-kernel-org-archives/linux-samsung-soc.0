Yeah, the wrong removals seemed to me like a left over from a previous attempt
to reorganize the code.

I see, then I prefer the opposite and do something like this on s3c64xx_spi_probe():

if (!pdev->dev.of_node)
       spi->cs_gpio = cs->line;

So, cs->line is only used by non-DT platforms to pass the GPIO to be used as
chip-select line. But after that use spi->cs_gpio should be used in every place.
If someday all the non-DT platforms are migrated to DT then only that assignment
has to be removed instead of several lines of code using cs->line currently.

Also is more consistent to use spi->cs_gpio like most SPI drivers do instead of
a custom structure member.

I don't get why you don't want to change legacy platform code if that means
improving the driver. If you don't feel confident with your changes because you
don't have access to the non-DT platform to test then you can post your patches
as RFC or ask people to with access to those platforms to test and collect some
Tested-by tags before the patch is merged.

sdd->cs_gpio has nothing to do with non-DT platforms AFAIU. It was introduced in
the commit that initially broke this binding and it's redundant information.

It's assigned to true on s3c64xx_spi_probe() and then set to false only if
of_find_property(pdev->dev.of_node, "cs-gpios", NULL) fails.

But you don't need an additional variable to get that info since
gpio_is_valid(spi->cs_gpio) or if (master->cs_gpios) can tell you the same AFAIK.
