As per Exynos5422 CMU

CLK_SCLK_USBPHY300 and CLK_SCLK_USBD300 are special clk meant to
control the usbdrd

CLK_SCLK_USBPHY300/1 is used for phy control
CLK_SCLK_USBD300/1 is used for link control.

On Odroid cloudshell module with old hard disk it time to time do reset of hub.
on heavy traffic of data.

At some time it work stable but eventfully their is loss of data.

On 3.10.x
It clk gate is tuned to support CLK_GATE_MULTI_BIT_SET, I am not sure
how this will apply on 4.x kernel
