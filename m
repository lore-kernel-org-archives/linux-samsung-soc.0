I think the idea was to make sure that regulator enables/disables were
balanced.  ...but if the mmc core does this for us then we probably
don't need to worry.

OK!  Can you explain more?  What instance is one powered but not the other?

I know that we talked to an SD Card manufacturer who told us that
powering their IO lines without their main power rail was a bad thing
(and we in fact saw this causing problems on SD cards).  I would guess
that means that you're either powering vmmc before vqmmc or that vqmmc
somehow doesn't directly enable pullups for IO lines.

If you need vmmc before vqmmc then I'm curious about why...
