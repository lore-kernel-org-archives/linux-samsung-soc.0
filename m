Well, and now how the driver knows if the device is "on" before accessing it?

Why would it?  If the device is runtime-suspended, the domain will know
that, because its callbacks will be used for that.  At least, that's
what I'd expect to happen, so is there a problem here?

I'd say we need to do something like this anyway.  That is, standardize on
*one* approach.  I'm actually not sure what approach is the most useful,
but the pm_runtime_get_sync() one seems to be the most popular to me.

I don't like that.  The API is already quite complicated in my view and
adding even more complexity to it is not going to help in the long run.

I'd say, 3) for now and 1) going forward.

That's fine, thanks for taking the time to lay out all of the cases, that's
always helpful.
