I guess it's not the correct assumption here. Sampling point tuning is =
to
tune the sampling point for data received on both CMD and DATA lines (n=
ot
just data lines). I can't find detailed mentioning of this in eMMC4.5
(that's the documentation short coming, you can even confirm whether tu=
ning
procedure is required for CMD line or not from JEDEC) but SD3.01
specification does mention this tuning procedure in great details. NOTE=
:
eMMC4.5 HS200 mode is mostly inspired from SD3.01 UHS-I bus speed modes=
=2E

Section " 4.2.4.5 Tuning Command" in "SD3.01 - Simplified
(Part_1_Physical_Layer_Simplified_Specification_Ver_3.01_Final_100518)"
specification(can be downloaded from here:
https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/), clearly states this:

4.2.4.5 Tuning Command
CMD19 is defined for Send Tuning Block Command. R1 type response is def=
ined.
CMD19 can be
executed in transfer state of 1.8V signaling mode while the card is
unlocked. The other case, CMD19 is
treated as illegal command. Data block, carried by DAT[3:0], contains a
pattern for tuning sampling
position to receive data on the CMD and DAT[3:0] line. The block length=
 of
CMD19 is fixed and CMD16
is not required.

So before tuning, you may get the Command CRC errors in HS200 mode.
