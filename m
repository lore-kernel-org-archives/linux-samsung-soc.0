Moving this seems to be a failure, the device is exposing a hwmon
interface even if you've moved the code to mfd (though it doesn't
actually look like a multi-function device at all as far as I can see -
usually a MFD would have a bunch of unrelated functionality while this
has one function used by two subsystems).

If anything it looks like the ADC driver ought to be moved into IIO with
either generic or Exynos specific function drivers layered on top of it
in hwmon and thermal making use of the values that are read.
