I've looking at this and a problem I found is that IIUC the set_irq_wake
is not propagated from the the Exynos pinctrl / GPIO driver which is the
combiner's external interrupt source so the callback is never called.
Which means that right now only the state of the wakeup source IRQs can't
be saved since that information is not present.

The drivers/pinctrl/samsung/pinctrl-exynos.c driver enables and disables
the combiner interrupts but its .irq_set_wake handler only updates the
wakeup source mask for the external interrupts but does not call the
combiner .set_irq_wake so that should be changed as well.

But even for non-wakeup interrupts, I found that they are not enabled when
adding the MASK_ON_SUSPEND on my tests. I don't know if that is related
to the pinctrl driver missing something else though.

Right, but can we do this as a follow-up? S2R is currently broken on these
machines and $subject is I think a reasonable small fix that won't introduce
any regressions.

To do a more intrusive change, I should better understand the interactions
between the Exynos pinctrl / GPIO, interrupt combiner and the GIC and in the
meantime S2R will continue to be broken on these platforms unless someone
more familiar with all this could point me in the right direction.
