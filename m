CCF isn't only for clocks that have single divider or gate control
register. One could define a clock that manipulates more than one
divider/gate in one CCF callback. It is already abstract enough. So
implementing a virtual clock is the solution, imho.
 BTW, on my platform linux needs to send a 'non-atomic' IPC message to
a master co-processor to scale up/down cpufreq. I just define a
virtual clock and use the generic bL cpufreq driver
drivers/cpufreq/arm_big_little.c
