Abhilash's email is also no longer valid.. :(

I think that the above voltages are original ones for Exynos5420
(not for Exynos5422/5800).

The voltages in my patch were taken from Hardkernel's kernel for
Odroid-XU3:

/*
 * ASV group voltage table
 */
static const unsigned int asv_voltage_5422_CA15[CPUFREQ_LEVEL_END_CA15] = {
...
	1250000,    /* L4  2000 */
	1250000,    /* L5  1900 */
	1250000,    /* L6  1800 */
...
