All cpufreq changes with needed dependencies are now availble in

    https://github.com/bzolnier/linux.git

repository and the branch is

    next-20150330-generic-cpufreq-exynos5420-5800-v2

Please note that Thomas' patchset was split on separate parts (this is
part #3) and heavily modified so the previous versioning was dropped.

The cover letter of part #1 ("[PATCH 0/6] cpufreq: use generic cpufreq
drivers for Exynos4210 platform") contains detailed changelog on what has
been changed since Thomas' original v12 patch series.  Individual Thomas'
patches which were modified by me also contain such information.

Part #2 ("[PATCH 0/6] cpufreq: use generic cpufreq drivers for Exynos4x12
platform") was entirely new code when compared to Thomas' v12 patchset so
its cover letter doesn't contain such detailed changelog as part #1.

The newly posted part #4 ("[PATCH 0/8] cpufreq: add generic cpufreq driver
support for Exynos5250/5800 platforms" https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/4/21/314)
also contains the detailed changelog.

However for part #3 (this one, "[PATCH 0/4] cpufreq: use generic cpufreq
drivers for Exynos5250 platform") such summary changelog got missed for
some reason.  Here it is:
- split Exynos5250 support from the original patch
- moved E5250_CPU_DIV[0,1]() macros to clk-exynos5250.c
- added CPU regulator supply property for Google Spring board
- removed exynos-cpufreq driver entirely as it is no longer used/needed

All issues previously reported should have been fixed.  If you still see
some problems please let me know.

[ I see now that exynos5420-arndale-octa.dts, exynos5420-peach-pit.dts,
  exynos5420-smdk5420.dts and exynos5800-peach-pi.dts should also have
  been updated to contain CPU cluster regulator supply properties or else
  if the default vdd_arm/vdd_kfc regulator state is set to too low value
  there may be problems with stability when switching to higher than
  default frequencies.  I have posted v2 version of patch #2/8 of part #4
  and pushed v2 combined branch on github.  Sorry for the inconvenience. ]
