OK, I'll fix it about your comment.

The most important issue is direct access to CMU registers, based on static mapping, which is not allowed on multiplatform kernels and multiplatform-awareness for drivers is currently a must.

I agree your opinion. When setting frequency of memory bus, this driver access
directly to CMU registers. I know it should be modified by using common clk
framework as your comment.

I'll send patch set about using common clk framework instead of CMU register
based on static mapping after finished the review and apply of this patch set as next step.

Thanks for your review.
