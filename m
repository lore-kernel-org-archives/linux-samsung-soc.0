That's not a hole as such.  It's an incompletely filled section, which is
precisely what sparsemem is all about.

That looks too loose to be useful - that means invalid page table entries
can pass the pfn_valid() test when they should actually fail, and I'd
imagine there will be many more such problems like that.

I agree - pfn_valid() on sparsemem needs to be tightened.
