FWIW, I came across a store at Guang Hua Digital Plaza today that had
the tiny6410+SDK board on display, and ended up buying one. It'll take
me a little while to wire it up for testing.

Seems like there's no upstream u-boot support for the board, so
getting something onto it that can network boot seems to be a long
shot. We'll see what I can cobble together.
