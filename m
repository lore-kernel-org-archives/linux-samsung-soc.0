This log indicates the problem of 'trats_stat' sysfs entry of devfreq f=
ramework
during kernel booting. But, this log don't affect the behavior of bus f=
requency
on Odroid-U3.

After completing kernel and platform booting, you can check the operati=
on
of Bus frequency with follwoing sysfs entry:

Also, when changing the frequency of each bus, exynos-bus.c show
the debug message. If you need more detailed information,
you could check this log message.
