This clock should have been 200MHz.

The clocks are same across working/non-working.
Is it possible to bisect the commit that's causing hang for 4.8x ?

Adding few of the folks from Samsung who can test dwc3 usb on smdk/peach bo=
ards.
+Alim, Pankaj

Hi Alim, Pankaj,
can you please give a try with 4.8 kernel on peach/smdk542x board and
see if dwc3 usb works or not.
You may need to the patches mentioned in [9.1] and [9.2] mentioned above.
