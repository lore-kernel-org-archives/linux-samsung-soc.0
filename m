Exactly, that was my point. Either the board is wired to do a eMMC reset
on reboot (like veyron), the SoC ROM bootloader has some logic to reset
the eMMC or the boards requires the kernel to do a eMMC reset so the hw
is in a known state to read from the eMMC on reboot (like Odroids).

So that's why I was arguing that it's very unlikely that doing an eMMC
reset could cause issues in other boards... but Krzysztof is correct
that you can't be sure without testing.

Thanks a lot for testing!

Yes, I actually gave some thought about choosing a number since I didn't
want to come with another arbitrary one. That's why I tried to understand
the policy as I mentioned before but I didn't find anything besides the
values listed in the register_restart_handler() doc: 0, 128 and 255.

It seems that most default system restart handlers use 128 and that's
the reason why gpio-restart and mmc-pwrseq-emmc use 129 and other restart
handlers that can be registered via DT use 192 (which is in the middle of
128 and 255).

So I actually thought to use a number in between 192 and 255 (i.e: 220)
but then there could be another platform that uses 221 instead of 200
so eMMC restart won't work there. That's why I finally chose the highest.

Do you know why the priority 200 was chosen for veyron gpi-restart ooi?
