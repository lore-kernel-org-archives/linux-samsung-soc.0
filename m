TBH I think most of the devices for which people are running these days
will be able to get some win from the system wide stuff - the WFI modes
aren't exactly the latest thing in hardware terms, it's just been a long
road to getting them supported.  Infrastructure like Mark's PM QoS work
and Raphael's PM domains work has really helped a lot here.

It's mostly a transition management issue I think.  When I repost I'll
add an additional patch on top which moves the clock gating into the
runtime PM callbacks, that way the decision on that doesn't block the
system wide work.
