Hmm, I doubt making the first argument of the notifier registration
function 'struct device_node *' is a good idea. AFAIK we shouldn't be
introducing and requiring device tree in generic interfaces.

We already tried an approach with pending notifier registration list.
I.e. when the power domain is not yet available we put the notification
registration request onto a separate list, which is then traversed
right before the power domain is registered with PM core.
Then we had a separate notification type for the notification client,
to let it know if his registration request has finally failed
permanently (invoked at some late initcall).

It all works, but it's not something we're really happy with. I hope
we can work out some reasonable solution for mainline. I will post
my PD transition notification patch, however it's mostly to demonstrate
the problem. In v2 PD can be also referred to by name, beside allowing
to just pass a struct device * to a device which belongs to a power
domain.
