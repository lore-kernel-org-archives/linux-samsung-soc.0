Another subtle issue is that there can be only one link between devices, but
it is common to request more than one channel per client device (for example
"tx" and "rx"), but this can be handled by internal reference counting.

I don't get how this will work. IMHO the link should be created WHEN client
driver requests the channel, because otherwise we will get links that might
be not used at all (for example optional DMA usage, but the link will force
DMA controller to active state even if client device doesn't want to use DMA
at all). So if client requests it for the first time and the DMA engine has
not been probed yet, there is no way to avoid -EPROBE_DEFER.

I also agree that the main problem here is lack of non-atomic call for
preparing the channel. However I don't feel I'm a right person for rewriting
all the existing DMA engine drivers and clients for the new API. :/
