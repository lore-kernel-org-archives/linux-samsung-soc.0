I'm looking at inline encryption by Google. 
I will find compatibility with inline encryption to avoid conflicts
in BIO/F2FS.
And changing bio iter has a benefit for diskcipher.
Without changing bio iter, diskcipher should control(alloc/free) a buffer
to hold a 'bi_dun' variable for every bio.
But changing bio iter is difficult to accept for block layer,
I will modify the diskcipher.
And, as you mentioned, inline encryption by Google has this control.
So I might be able to use it.

Thanks.
