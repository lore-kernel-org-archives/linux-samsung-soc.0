Hmm, if GIC v2 spec allows both cases, then this solution is not enough
indeed. I need to find some time to familiarize with necessary
documentation...

We don't. As I described in commit message, the driver expects
cpu_logical_map() to return a value from [0...N-1] range where N is the
number of CPUs and that respective per-CPU bank is located at gic_base +
cpu_offset * cpu_logical_map(). There are two problems with this:

a) after adding CPU topology data to DT, cpu_logical_map() starts
returning lower 24 bits of MPIDR and certain SoCs have non-zero cluster
ID, even if there is only a single cluster present,

b) obviously for multi-cluster SoCs the above assumption doesn't stand.

It sounds quite good. I'll try to get this implemented in next version,
but after looking through GIC v2 spec first.

Best regards,
