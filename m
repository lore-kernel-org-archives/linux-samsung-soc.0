It's hard to disagree with any of the opinions presented here. We want 
to support Exynos5250-based hardware, but at the same time we don't want 
to regress any hardware unaffected by mentioned issue...

Let me propose you a solution that comes to my mind (as discussed with 
ojn on #armlinux):

To work around the erratum we basically need to ensure that two things 
are done:

  1) At boot-up the L2 controller configured by R/O firmware need to
     be reconfigured to sane values.

  2) At resume from sleep mode the same process as in 1) must be done.

As for the first one, it might be handled either by R/W firmware of the 
board or some small loader code glued in front of zImage. Second one can 
be implemented in SoC-specific resume code 
(arch/arm/plat-samsung/s5p-sleep.S), as it's currently done with L2X0 on 
Exynos4.

Of course this is scattering the workaround over multiple code bases, 
but this way the workaround is executed only on affected platforms 
without hurting the unaffected ones. What do you think?

Best regards,
Tomasz
