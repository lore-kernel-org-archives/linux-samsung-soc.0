Ah, good. I'll try to make more code conditional then.

I would prefer option 3. That is also easier to implement with a straightforward
DT binding that defines a single node with the clock registers. The location
doesn't have an obvious answer, but I would probably put them into
drivers/clocksource if the PWM maintainer agrees.

Option 2 would probably come down to having a trivial MFD driver exposing
a regmap. You can probably reuse drivers/mfd/syscon.c for this and make
the node compatible with "syscon" to designate the clock registers as
a system-wide resource, making the other device nodes register-less.
