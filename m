Would you elaborate?

If I have a device like a phone, I may want to put one "slot" inside
phone for basic system, and offer second slot for user expansion
(initially empty).

Or I may want to have internal slot with a card to boot from and have
external slot (initially empty) for system update for embedded system.

I see quite an obvious benefit there.
