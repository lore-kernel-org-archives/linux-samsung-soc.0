Hi Rui,

The above implementation  also cools instance based cooling devices
like passive trip type. I need some changes on top of your
implementation such as,
thermal_set_cooling_state() {
    list_for_each_entry(instance, &tz->cooling_devices,
                                     node) {
        cdev =3D instance->cdev;
        if (!cdev->trips & 1<<count)
                  continue;

        inst_id =3D 0;
        for_each_bit_set(i, cdev->trips, count)
                   inst_id++;
         cdev->ops->get_max_state(cdev, &max_state);
         if ((temp >=3D trip_temp) && (inst_id <=3D max_state))
              cdev->ops->set_cur_state(cdev, inst_id);
         else if ((temp < trip_temp) && (--inst_id >=3D 0))
               cdev->ops->set_cur_state(cdev, inst_id);
     }
}

I agree with you that the instance based trip types violates the
concept like reading the cur_state and do cur_state++/cur_state--
depending upon threshold increase or decrease because it needs the
state_id/inst_id.
I am actually thinking of dropping this new trip type and use the
existing THERMAL_TRIP_ACTIVE because there is so much logic in
calculating the state_id. The only flip side of using TRIP_ACTIVE is
that I need to create so many cooling devices.

Thanks,
Amit D
