but there is only one host controller to handle these commands.
the generic sdhci driver has cmd19 hard coded, thats the reason I
asked the question.
you can also check it in the function sdhci_execute_tuning it is hard c=
oded as
cmd.opcode =3D MMC_SEND_TUNING_BLOCK; where the macro value is 19.
So in case of SD card insertion it will send a SEND_TUNING_BLOCK
command to the device. but if
MMC card is inserted then it will send a BUS_TEST_W command to the devi=
ce.

correct me if i am wrong
