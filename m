Thank you that you have applied and for the hint.

In the cover letter there is sentence:
'The suspending device has now chance to set proper
state when the system is going for suspend. This phase is the right place
to set needed frequences for the next resume process.'
Generally speaking, there is a need of setting the right
frequency/voltage, because we need that frequency during resume,
i.e. for booting CPUs (which are poked earlier during resume than the 
buses in this design).
