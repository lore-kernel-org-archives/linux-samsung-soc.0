Why don't you create a cpuidle driver for each SoC family ?

I am cleaning up all the drivers to unify the code, hoping we can facto=
r
all the drivers through a single ARM driver and assign the ops for the
different states.

As Thomasz said, the platform driver model should be used, no need of
initcall, the code path will initialize the driver or not depending of
the SoC. You should not have any "soc_is_*" checks. This is the
direction all the ARM drivers are going to.

Look at the example I sent with the ux500, it illustrates the idea.
There are other examples also: cpuidle-kirkwood.c, cpuidle for davinci.

Concerning the "single cpu power down" state, is the exynos able to
handle that ? I mean, is it possible to power down a core and have it
woken up by an interrupt ?

Concerning the AFTR state : Is there a way to use this state with *all*
cpus online ? If not, shall we use the same approach than omap4, that i=
s
CPU0 power down CPU1 and goes to AFTR (all interrupts migrated to CPU0)
and then wake up CPU1 when CPU0 is woken up ?

Concerning WFI and sysfs, if there are no cpuidle driver registered, no
sysfs. I would not focus on and spent too much effort for the statistic=
s
because a lot of changes will certainly happen with the power aware
scheduler and the statistics will likely appear at this level.
