Yes. It might be not small changes. Moreover, it needs to test heavily.
But it should be done before long. As we experienced, there are some race issue
in current way. Will you update this patch? Please let me know.

I think dw_mmc conforms itself to typical driver's implementation,
which it may be about a choice of driver's design.

Ah, the above-mentioned steps describes scenario when changing lock scheme.
