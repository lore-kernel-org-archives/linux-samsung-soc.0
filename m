Sorry for explaining myself badly. I just tried to say that this is a decision
that has to be made on a per-driver basis but I don't really know if makes
sense or not in this case since I don't know if this device is (or could be)
shipped on non-DT platforms. Nick is in a much better position to answer that
question.

Best regards,
Javier
