I wanted let other possible handlers potentially use mmc if needed (although there is no such case atm). Now it turns that this approach was not the best idea, because there are other board-specific restart handlers with higher priority than the default I was using. IMHO the change proposed by Javier seems to be the best solution for now. The other possibility would be to entirely get rid of restart handler usage and wire this logic to mmc_shutdown(). This makes sense from the logical point of view, but the drawback of this solution is the lack of proper reset sequence in case of emergency reboot (shutdown callbacks are not called on emergency reboot).

Thanks a lot for your feedback, I'm glad that you agree with the change then.
