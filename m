Hello,

This patchset adds new mmc power sequence driver, which performs eMMC
card hardware reset. Such power sequence, involving resetting emmc card,
is required on some boards to properly perform system reboot procedure.

This patchset originates from fixes for the reboot hang issue on
Hardkernel's Odroid boards with eMMC card. Those boards are designed in
such a way, that the eMMC nreset signal is routed to SoC GPIO line
instead of the board reset logic. To properly restard system and let ROM
bootloader to read next bootloader from eMMC, one need to reset emmc
card before performing reboot.

The initial patches consisted of a complete reset/power off driver, but
after further analysis, it turned out that only eMMC nreset line control
logic is specific for those boards. Everything else can be done by the
MMC code. Sjoerd Simons and Jaehoon Chung suggested that such feature is
something generic, not really specific to the MMC host controller used
on Odroid boards, so it should be implemented in MMC core. Then, Ulf
Hansson suggested to use recently introduced power sequences driver for
implementing this feature.

This patches provides a simple mmc-pwrseq-emmc driver, which controls
single gpio line and performs eMMC reset procedure just after card power
on and just before turning it off or performing system reboot. This
driver has been instantiated on Odroid X2/U3 and XU3 boards.

Patches are prepared on top of linux-next.

Changelog:

v2:
- moved all code to separate mmc-prwseq-emmc driver

v1:
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-samsung-soc@vger.kernel.org/msg41641.html
- moved all the code and logic to mmc core (slot-gpio.c), so it is
  available to all mmc drivers, which uses device tree

v0:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/42477/
- separated emmc reset logic from other code and moved to exynos dw-mmc
  driver

initial version:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.power-management.general/51855/
- separate reset driver implementing all the logic
