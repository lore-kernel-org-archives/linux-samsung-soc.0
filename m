Ok, so it's only a problem on Exynos platform for now.

So what would be a better way to handle this? Going back to setup_irq or 
trying to enable/disable irqs on CPU hotplug? As this touched low level 
things and it's rare case for setting/enabling irqs just after CPU is 
coming back to life again.

No the boot looks clean and there is not any sign of that problem.

That's most probably the reason of no warnings on boot process.
