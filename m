I think you're mis-understanding for it.
Right, It's described at exynos5420, but it's not connected.
Exynos4 series are also described, but we used the broken card detection scheme and power used one of "always-on" powers.
Because Card-detection rail need to enable as "always-on".

We don't need to consider this. I checked the circuit, this patch didn't need.

exynos5 also used the gpio-pin for card-detection. And we can use the slot-gpio API.
