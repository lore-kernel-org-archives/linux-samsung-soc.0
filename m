For ARMv7, in the past you could not do this. It behaved (almost)
always the same as it is now. The PMU driver was being compiled in if
ARCH_EXYNOS is selected.

On ARMv8 - Exynos7 - there was no PMU driver so indeed this behavior
changes. However PMU driver now is necessary for pinctrl (and actually
for some others referring by syscon) so really you cannot disable it
and expect things to work. Menuconfig serves such purpose - user
(distro config developer) can choose what he wants but he wants to
boot the kernel. People in general and people setting up configs for
distro usually do not know all the subtle SoC submodule relations for
all of the SoCs. That is our responsibility to provide them something
which is usable.

On the other hand, for debugging we always had to change some things.
That's debugging.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
