Actually in this case the issue is slightly different - the fixes are
mostly fixes for issues introduced by other development going in during
this merge window, what's gone wrong is that they've been applied to a
different branch to that which had the problem.  Still an issue of
course, just a different one.

That said there's also an issue if pure development gets delayed - it
makes it harder to do further work based on top of the work that got
delayed, especially if any cross tree issues come into play.

That's not an issue here, all the stuff that's being discussed is in
-next but not sent to the arm-soc tree.
