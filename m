Since we sleep inside the protected section we need to use a mutex.

It's not the timeout case I'm worried about, but the case where the transfer
is interrupted by the user. Even though it is rather unlikely for the
problem to occur we should still try to avoid it, this is one of these
annoying heisenbugs that happen once in a while and nobody is able to
reproduce them.

I think most of this is already implemented and Naveen sent a patch to reset
the controller in case of a timeout, which is a good idea and works fine,
but you still should handle the case where the user aborted the transfer.
Just resetting the core should work as well in that case.
