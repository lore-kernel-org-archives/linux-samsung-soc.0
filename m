Submitting the V4 version of exynos5440 cpufreq driver. This patchset addresses
all the coding and design concerns raised especially by Viresh.

Changes in V4:
* Added dev_err logs instead of pr_err.
* Used the devm_ioremap_resource API.
* Implemented several coding guidelines and minor error comments from Sylwester,
  Russell and Viresh.

Changes in V3:
* Converted the driver to probe based as suggested by Viresh. This is also
  beneficial for multiplatform kernel.
* Other coding guidelines related changes.
* Moved the DT node outside cpu0 node as the driver is now a platform
  driver.

Changes in V2:
* Added OPP library support to parse DT parameters.
* Removed a hack to handle interrupts in bootup.
* Implemented other review comments from Viresh and Inder.

All these patches are dependent on Thomas Abraham common clock patches.
