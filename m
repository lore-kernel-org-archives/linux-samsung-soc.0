Firstly, use sparsemem, unless you intentionally want to spend more
cycles in the kernel.

You're into the classic problem which happens when you don't tackle
these kinds of issues as soon as the first one occurs.  If you allow
them to persist for any time, getting rid of them later becomes very
difficult.  I suspect that you're rather stuck now.

There is no way to do this in the kernel.

NODE_MEM_SIZE_MASK is DISCONTIGMEM specific; it doesn't exist for
flatmem nor sparsemem (where it's not relevant.)

It's also complicated by platforms which compress their physical RAM
space to fit inside the virtual mappings, eg:

 * 256MB @ 0x00000000 -> PAGE_OFFSET
 * 512MB @ 0x20000000 -> PAGE_OFFSET + 0x10000000
 * 256MB @ 0x80000000 -> PAGE_OFFSET + 0x30000000

The only other solution would be for platforms to declare valid areas
of physical memory back to the setup_arch() code, so that it can
verify the parameters passed - but that's an awful lot of effort just
to fix idiotically implemented boot loaders.
