Changes since v3:
- Addressed comments from Grant Likely.
  - Set num_rows and num_cols to zero in samsung_keypad_parse_dt function.
  - Fixed the wierd looking if-else block in samsung_keypad_probe function.

Changes since v2:
- Addressed comments from Grant Likely.
  - Renamed 'keypad,key-code' property name to 'linux,code'.
  - Fixed incorrect data types for all instances of of_property+read_u32.
  - linux,input-type binding was not added as suggested since the driver
    supports only EV_KEY event type.

Changes since v1:
- Addressed comments from Dmitry Torokhov.
  - Type of controller is cached in driver's private data and the function
    that determines the type of the controller for each keypad scan is
    removed.
  - pdata allocated during probe is explicitly freed after probe completes
    without any error. In case of exit from probe due a error, no explicit
    deallocation of pdata memory is performed and it is left to devres to
    handle that.
  - The generic code to translate KEY(x,y,code) is retained in the driver
    itself. I am unsure of a right common place for it.
  - Driver continues with the probe even if one or more gpio configuration
    fails.
  - Patch 1 that adds a new config option is still retained in this patchset.


This patchset adds device tree support for samsung's keypad controller driver.
First patch adds a new config option to be used by device tree enabled platforms
for selecting the samsung's keypad controller driver. The second patch adds device
tree support for the keypad driver.
