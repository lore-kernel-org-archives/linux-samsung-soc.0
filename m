I know what that function is, but using it alone is not sufficient,
because dev->kobj.state_in_sysfs is set before the device is added to
dpm_list.

There are some cases to consider and some races to avoid AFAICS.

It all gets a lot simpler if device_link_add() is allowed to return NULL when
the supplier device passed to it has not been registered yet.  That looks like
a reasonable thing to do to me, but I wonder if someone has a use case in which
it would be a substantial limitation.

Thanks,
Rafael
