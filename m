You seem to have mixed up the consumer and supplier in point 8 above.
Your code is such that the SYSMMU is the supplier and the master device
is the consumer:

	device_link_add(dev, data->sysmmu, DL_FLAG_PM_RUNTIME);

Prototype of device_link_add:

	struct device_link *device_link_add(struct device *consumer,
				            struct device *supplier,
					    u32 flags);

Your code is correct, only point 8 above is wrong.

Best regards,

Lukas
