No, he won't.

Simply because no new SoC is going to be made which will use the 
samsung_pwm_timer driver and all existing ones have only a single instance 
of this IP.

This is the information passed through output_mask. Clocksource driver can 
use _only_ channels without output and PWM driver can use _only_ channels 
with output.

Both drivers receive the same output_mask value, either from the same 
variant structure or from device tree.

Those are completely safe assumptions for existing platforms. Any new 
platform with the same PWM IP will use this driver exclusively, without the 
clocksource driver and so without the problems you mentioned.
