This notifier is just to let others that the deferred probe has happened and
it is a good time to retry operation, which earlier failed due to missing
resources (i.e. power domains, clocks). Such case is with registering AMBA
device (not the driver!). During AMBA device registration, bus code has 
to read
some device's registers to get its device CID/PID. To do this, device's 
clocks
and power domain has to be turned on. Those however might not be available
that time. With this notifier, AMBA bus code is able to retry device
registration, which earlier failed due to missing clocks or power domain.

This CID/PID reading has to be done during device registration time because
of the already deployed userspace ABI. CID/PID values are reported to
userspace, which might rely on them to load proper driver modules.
