No, the C standard doesn't make any guarantees about the size of types,
it is up to the implementation of the compiler. If I rember correctly
the only guarantee in the lanugage definition is that char->short->int-=

be that the next up the line be at-least as a  big as the one before.

be
fine too. I'm not going to worry too much about this.
