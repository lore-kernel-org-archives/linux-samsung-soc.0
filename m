I guess the only relation to other users is the "mmio-sram". In the same
time this is still similar to e.g. Samsung's sram bindings (where the
memory is mapped to CPU only).

Being located in drivers/soc is not an issue here - code for other
vendors may be moved there as well in the future.

Of course I do not insist. Actually Rob's comment was only about moving
sram.txt and Samsung's sram to common place.

Anyway I will be sending v3 of these because while looking more
carefully I found hard-coded paths to bindings/misc/sram.txt. I'll fix
it in next version.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
