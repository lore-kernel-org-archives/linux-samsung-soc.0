I'm sorry, my wording wasn't the best here. I'm not critizing the work
done here, merely voicing my concern (and also interest!) about how the
new stuff interacts with code that may eventually get merged.
You're aware of it, that's enough for me to know.

No, of course not. That was pretty stupid of me :(

That's certainly good to hear!

I've got a question concerning this. Is this only needed for
exynos-cpufreq, or does cpufreq-dt also need something like that.

The point is that I'm still working with a rather old version of the
cpufreq series, a version which still had the Exynos4x12 code in it
(this was removed later, if I remember correctly because of problems
with how to properly describe boost configuration in DT).


Anyway, to not get completly off-topic here, I noticed some small issue
with v3 of the thermal series. I've enabled CONFIG_THERMAL_HWMON so that
I can use lm_sensors to query temperature of the board. However while
the thermal_zone is created, there is no hwmon node to be found. This
was working properly without the thermal series.


With best wishes,
Tobias
