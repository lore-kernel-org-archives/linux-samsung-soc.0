OK.

USB type C does not have dedicated video lines, it has only: HS, SS, SBU
(and optionally CC) data lines[1] and in my RFC I have modeled data
lines as graph ports. If USB-C interface controller supports alternate
mode (currently there are specs for DisplayPort, HDMI, MHL alternate
modes, but there can be more), SS lines can be used to transmit video
data (or any other type of data defined by alternate mode), but it means
there will be SS mux somewhere before connector, for muxing USB-SS and
alternate lines. So yes, video will be at port 1, but this is still port
for SS lines:

USB3 --> MUX --> CONNECTOR
DP -------^

I do not see why we would need separate video port.
