This probably comes about because devices that are part of a power
domain need special treatment.  Before the driver's probe routine gets
called, the bus ought to resume the entire power domain.  For that,
some sort of _get_sync() is needed.

For devices that aren't part of a power domain, things are simpler.  
The bus does _get_noresume() to make sure the device won't be runtime 
suspended while the probe routine is running.  It doesn't do 
_get_sync(), because that would end up calling the driver's 
runtime_resume routine before the driver was bound to the device.  (The 
bus could prevent that from happening by taking special precautions,
like PCI does, but in general it's a nuisance.)
