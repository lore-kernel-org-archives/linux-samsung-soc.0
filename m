Recently we landed 03de19212ea3 ("mmc: dw_mmc: introduce timer for
broken command transfer over scheme").  I found a bunch of problems
with that patch, so this series attempts to solve some of them.

This also fixes the DTO timer in some of the same ways even though I
haven't personally seen problems with the DTO timer.

NOTE: this series has only been lighly tested so far.  I can at least
reproduce the need for the CTO timer on one of my devices and so I can
confirm that part still works.  As mentioned in the 3rd patch I also
ran the mmc_test kernel module on this and did manage to see the 3rd
patch doing something useful.

Changes in v2:
- Removed extra "int i"
- Fix the DTO timeout calculation new for v2
- Cleanup the DTO timer new for v2

Douglas Anderson (5):
  mmc: dw_mmc: cancel the CTO timer after a voltage switch
  mmc: dw_mmc: Fix the CTO timeout calculation
  mmc: dw_mmc: Add locking to the CTO timer
  mmc: dw_mmc: Fix the DTO timeout calculation
  mmc: dw_mmc: Cleanup the DTO timer like the CTO one
