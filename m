In this case the driver don't need to access the device during
->probe(). That's postponed until sometime later.

Genpd do knows about the device but it doesn=E2=80=99t get a "notificat=
ion" to
power off. There are no issues whatsoever for driver.

This is a somewhat special case. Let's go through an example.

1. The PM domain is initially in powered off state.
2. The bus ->probe() invokes dev_pm_domain_attach() and then the PM
domain gets attached to the device.
3. $subject patch causes the PM domain to power on.
4. A driver ->probe() sequence start, following the Scenario 5).
5. The device is initially in runtime PM suspended state and it will
remain so during ->probe().
6. The pm_request_idle() invoked after really_probe() in driver core,
won't trigger a runtime PM suspend callback to be invoked. In other
words, genpd don't get a "notification" that it may power off.

In this state, genpd will either power off from the late_initcall,
genpd_poweroff_unused() (depending on when the driver was probed) or
wait until some device's runtime PM suspend callback is invoked at any
later point.

I absolutely agree that we shouldn't add unnecessary APIs and keep
APIs as simple as possible.

In that context, I think the effect from proceeding with Option 2)
also means there are no need for the below APIs any more.
pm_genpd_poweron()
pm_genpd_name_poweron() (requires some additional work though)
pm_genpd_poweroff_unused()
pm_genpd_dev_need_restore()

I guess you figured out that I am in favour of Option 2). :-)
Especially since it cover all scenarios and we don't have to go a fix
a vast amount of drivers.

This could work!

The hardest part is to know when we should revert $subject patch, to
fix the regression introduced for scenario 5).
