IMHO, any HW configurations should be done in alloc_chan_resources 
callback and
it would be best if a pointer of slave device will come as a parameter 
to it.

Okay, so what is the conclusion? Do you want me to do the whole rework 
of dma
engine core to get this runtime pm patchset for pl330 merged??? Is there any
roadmap for this rework prepared, so I can at least take a look at the 
amount
of work needed to be done?

I'm rather new to dma engine framework and I only wanted to fix pl330 driver
not to block turning off the power domain on Exynos5422/5433 SoCs.

I can also check again if there is any other way to find the slave device in
alloc_chan_resources, like for example scanning the device tree for 
phandles,
to avoid changing dmaengine core as this turned out to be too problematic
before one will do the proper dma engine core rework.
