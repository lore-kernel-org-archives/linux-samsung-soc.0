So without these capabilities mentioned microSD card cannot be used? So
I have a UHS-I card, that one exactly:
http://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/product/MB-MP32D/APC

It works:
[    2.628365] mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 50000000Hz (slot req
50000000Hz, actual 50000000HZ div = 0)
[    2.693296] mmc1: new high speed SDHC card at address 0001
[    2.703867] mmcblk0: mmc1:0001 00000 29.8 GiB
[    2.708406]  mmcblk0: p1 p2

This is just HS mode.

In the same time isn't UHS-I backward compatible? Your report seems
surprising.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
