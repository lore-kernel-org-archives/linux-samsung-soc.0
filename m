This patch set adds support for Exynos SROM controller DT based driver.
Currently SROM register sets are used only during S2R, so driver
basically added for taking care of S2R. It will help us in removing
static mapping from exynos.c and other extra code handline during S2R.

This patch set also updated exynos4 and exynos5 dtsi files for with device
node for srom, and added binding documentation for the same.

First two patches are some minor cleanup in mach-exynos.

 - Removed unnedded NULL assignments from exynos_srom_remove function.
 - Added PM depency for selecting CONFIG_EXYNOS_SROM. 
Changes since v3:
 - Rebased to lastet kgene tree.
 - Added platform data support, instead of using global variables for srom base
 - Addressed review comments from LABBE Corentin
