The ePAPR lists underscore as a acceptable character... but if you
insists then the sensible solution would be to rename all the nodes to
something like:
-       ncp15wb473@3 {
+       thermistor3 {

Is it okay?

This does not look entirely as an addressable thing. Altough this
particular driver (ntc_thermistor.c) uses one iio-channel... but others
are often using more than one.

The Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/samsung/exynos-adc.txt
mentions that sensors can be added as child nodes or separately. The
exynos_adc driver indeed calls of_platform_populate() but I am not sure
why this was added.
