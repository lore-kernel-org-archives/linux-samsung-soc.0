Well, as you explained in you answer to patch 5, pwm_apply_args()
should be called on a per-request basis (each time a PWM device is
requested), while the initial polarity setting should only be applied
when registering the PWM chip (and its devices). After that, the
framework takes care of keeping the PWM state in sync with the hardware
state.

Let's take a real (though a bit unusual) example. Say you have a single
PWM device referenced by two different users. Only one user can be
enabled at a time, but each of them has its own reference config
(different polarity, different period).

User1 calls pwm_get() and applies its own polarity and period. Then
user1 is unregistered and release the PWM device, leaving the polarity
and period untouched.

User2 is registered and request the same PWM device, but user2 is
smarter and tries to extract the current PWM state before adapting the
config according to pwm_args. If you just reset pwm->state.polarity
each time pwm_apply_args() is called (and you suggested to call it as
part of the request procedure), then this means the PWM state is no
longer in sync with the hardware state.
