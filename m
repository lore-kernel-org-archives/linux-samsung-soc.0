We probably should also add that it's highly unlikely that anyone
using S5PV210 actually uses a standalone DTB, since those systems
normally predated DT support in bootloaders and workarounds such as
chainloading or appended DTB are normally used.

Looking through the series, the idea seems to be very reasonable, so:

Thanks for cleaning this up!
