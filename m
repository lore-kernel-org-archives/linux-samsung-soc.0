That is true and I agree.

Are we open to creating a completely mutually-exclusive binding and
maintain the legacy one as "legacy support without any modification"
while we debate the new binding? I dont deny that we have more bandage
discussions that we'd like on these bindings, So, would like views if
we want to define a better one from scratch rather than continue to
figure out how to live with existing one?

Here are the options I can think of.
1. New binding: Lets say each OPP as phandles? -> that sounds like the
closest I have heard as something that remotely makes sense to scale
properties?
2. Remove OPP bindings entirely - only way to add/modify OPP is from
platform code.

Anyone has better suggestions what we can do?
