IMHO this case simply shows that ExynosDRM driver should manage IO address
space on it's own, because DMA-mapping api is too limited. ExynosDRM is
unlikely to be used on a hardware other than Samsung Exynos, so it can
better use hardware if it access IOMMU and CMA subsystems directly and
have its own address space manager to avoid hacking in internal structures
of dma-mapping.
