Yes, gpio_is_valid() is not a direct substitute for boolean cs_gpio.

It was a review comment to use gpio_is_valid() and quickly iterated
another version with that change.  Now that we see gpio_is_valid() is
breaking the native chip select for gpio number 0. Shall i go back to
using the boolean or do you have a better way to do this.

spi-s3c64xx.c is supporting a wide range of SoCs ranging from s3c64xx
series followed by s5p series and then exynos4 and exynos5 series.
However, Exynos4 and Exynos5 series currently available are all DT based.
Support for DT and non-DT was taken good care.

Revision number went to 5 for minor changes like
1. Missing documentation
2. Using gpio_is_valid() instead of boolean cs_gpio
3. Adding SignedOff-By and Acked-By

The intention of the patch was to fix the broken platforms by implementing
dt bindings similar to generic SPI core in spi-s3c64xx.c.

Current dt bindings:
spi-s3c64xx.c is expects the cs-gpio" property in the SPI DT node
and also defined under the "controller-data".

Solution 1:
Add support for "cs-gpios" property in the SPI DT node and
remove "cs-gpio" from sub node "controller-data".

Solution 2:
As Javier suggested
//
Inverting the default of cs_gpio. and By default not having the
"cs-gpio" property in the SPI dev node should mean that the "cs-gpio"
property in the controller-data node should be used to signal the
chip-select and having the "cs-gpio" property in the SPI node should
mean that the native chip select should be used instead of a GPIO.
That preserves the old DT binding semantic while making the GPIO to be optional
//

in this case spi-s3c64xx.c will continue to ignore the generic SPI "cs-gpios"
implementation.

I'm willing to implement any suggestion to fix this issue.
