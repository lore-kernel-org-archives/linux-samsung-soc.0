I tested it through "SPI test application" and "aplay". It works well on both.

There are two reason why I change it.

First, Original DMA machine code made a "peri_id" variable to contain 
"event(interrupt) number (0~31)" information.
But, I think "event(interrupt) number (0~31)" information can be retained in 
"pch->chan.chan_id" instead of "peri_id" if DMA machine code passes the peri 
information in order of "event (interrupt) number".

I mean to say that new variable(-->'peri_id') is not need to contain "event 
(interrupt) number" information. "pch->chan.chan_id" can take place of it. And 
this makes the meaning of "pch->chan.chan_id" more informative because .

Second, A magic value is required to find the DMA channel desired by DMA 
client on multi-platform.
This value is used on "dma_filter_fn filter()" function to find the channel.
I changed that the meaning of "peri_id" to use for it from "event(interrupt) 
number (0~31)" to "a magic value".
If you can accept this change about meaning of 'peri_id', I will create new 
value on " struct dma_pl330_peri" to contain a magic value.

I think this patch is good because no need to new value for "a magic value" 
and make "pch->chan.chan_id" more infomative.
Do you still want to change this patch?

Do you want to separate this patch more finely?
If yes, I will divide it into two patches. First patch will be for 
dma_slave_config. Second patch will be for cyclic capability.
