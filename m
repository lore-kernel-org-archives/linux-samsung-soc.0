Careful.  By saying "for all clusters" you might be interpreted as 
saying that the CCI must be turned on even for CPUs that are not powered 
up.

Let me respectfully disagree.

Are you promoting for the removal of drivers/bus/arm-cci.c ?

You do realize that the fundamental raison d'être for MCPM is actually 
to manage the race free enabling of the cache and CCI ?

Lorenzo: Don't get me wrong.  The Chromebooks, and possibly to some 
extent some people at Samsung, were simply too confident in their 
ability to create absolutely bug-free firmware code to the point of not 
making its update easy in the field.  This is completely outrageous in 
my point of view.  Yet one of the reactions was to call upstream kernel 
people as purists because the kernel is so much easier to modify in 
order to cover their mess and yet that might not be accepted.  Like I 
said I won't stop shaming them publicly for their own "incompetence" 
just yet (no pun intended), but being excessively purist does not 
benefit anyone either, and for that they have a point.

*HOWEVER* I have no choice but to say that many people at ARM, including 
a couple individuals for whom I nevertheless have a lot of admiration, 
also have an incredible faith in their ability to convince themselves, 
and then turn around to preach to the world, that *more firmware* is 
going to be so much purer and solve so many more problems than it 
creates and become such a magical success that we should immediately 
dedicate our soul to the cause with no hint of a doubt.

I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but I don't believe in this one iota.

Let me repeat the MCPM story again: it took 3 people, including 2 from 
ARM, over *six* months to get everything right and stable on TC2. I 
think you also contributed to that effort as well. Subsequent MCPM 
backend contributions (yes, just the backend and not the core code) took 
at least *five* rounds of reviews in one case, and after *seven* rounds 
in another case it is still not right, despite the publicly available 
TC2 implementation to serve as a reference.

I'm sure each time a new patch set was posted, their authors honestly 
believed their code was correct.  Otherwise why would they post buggy 
code?

Now you are telling me that they should have put that code into firmware 
instead?  Can you realize what a catastrophe this would have been? Are 
you _seriously_ believing that they would be up to their 5th firmware 
revision by now?  And that updating their firmware six months after 
product launch would be as easy as updating the kernel?

Software ALWAYS has bugs, whether it is user apps, the kernel, firmware 
or boot ROM. The bigger one of those parts is, the more bugs it will 
have. And the cost to vendors for fixing those bugs grow exponentially 
down each level. For proof, we're now considering possible workarounds 
in the kernel to sidestep the difficulty with updating the firmware on a 
Chromebook.

Yet you're saying that firmware should grow code with the same 
complexity as the MCPM core, plus a machine specific backend that 
experience has proven multiple times is evidently hard to get right, 
into firmware because running Linux in secure mode is wrong?  If so we 
don't live in the same world indeed.

The day I see a firmware architecture that allows for 1) the same level 
of peer review as what we enjoy with the Linux kernel code and 2) the 
same ability to perform updates in the field as the kernel, then maybe I 
could be sold on the many advantages having generic firmware might have.  
In the meantime I consider complex firmware as a very suboptimal 
architecture with no bearing on the reality of actual short-cycled 
products, and if they prevail we'd better be ready to pile more of those 
ugly hacks in the kernel.
