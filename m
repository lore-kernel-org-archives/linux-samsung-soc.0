I agree. Mostly we use:
1. Common DTSI and final addons/customizations in DTS.
2. Several common DTSI for specific parts (like sound).

The difference below (I removed it from the quote) is indeed very small,
thanks Chanwoo for pointing this. However having common DTSI should not
end with much bigger final diff between files. I mean that it should be
the same amount of lines in total...

Actually, after applying this patch, the final exynos5433-tm2e.dts is
exactly the same as before. To me, this is a indication that a common
file is a good approach.

I agree, 'status = disable' in final DTS is not a common pattern and
to me when reading, it makes me wonder what was the author's intention.

Also including a DTS in DTS is not a common pattern, neither. It appears
(git grep include arch/arm/boot/dts | grep 'dts"') in few places but it
is not obvious. At least to me.

Overall, I prefer the common approach.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
