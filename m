Hello Krzysztof,

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

Agreed, but that would be a much intrusive core change affecting every single
platform so I didn't feel brave enough to attempt it :)

But regardless of the ABBA deadlock, there are reasons why the clk API is
split into an {,un}prepare and {en,dis}able functions (e.g: non-atomic vs
atomic) and it is a common pattern for drivers to prepare the clock(s) on
setup (i.e: probe), unprepare on driver removal, and just {en,dis}able the
clock(s) during runtime.

So I believe this patch is good on its own and at least makes the driver more
consistent with most I2C controller drivers that do the same w.r.t clocks. The
fact that the deadlock is fixed by this change is just a nice side effect IMHO.

Yes, I in fact thought the same when writing the patch but was reluctant to
change the prepared state in suspend because I don't have a way to test the
S2R path in this board due broken firmware that prevents the cores to enter
into deep sleep states (I believe is the same issue we faced with CPUidle).

But I'll do the change that you suggested since I agree with you.
