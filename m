It's based on the point where the ftrace updates were merged into my
tree.  I can't produce all the patches that lead up to this set because
there's just too many.

However, it probably applies cleanly on top of the devel-stable stuff.

It's scheduled for the next merge window.

Will add the missing include.

Normally, this is because sched_clock() is called prior to the mapping
for reading the counter being available, but this is no different from
what was already there.  So, I suspect that n2100 doesn't boot without
these patches applied either.

Any chance of an boot log using the early printk or debug_ll stuff?

Thanks - will add that to the IXP4xx specific parts.
