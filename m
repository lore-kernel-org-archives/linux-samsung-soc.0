All existing dt support in samsung drivers use this format and it
works fine. But I could not complete work on time and pull request for
samsung-dt support for 3.2 was delayed and hence rejected. So for now,
it is out of tree but available in linux-next.

This may lead to linux specific information getting into the device
tree. And that might not be acceptable.

Device tree is expected to describe the hardware. So to
cross-reference the hardware manual to understand device tree should
be fine I guess. For instance, GPIO numbers in dts would be written as
a numeric number and not a enum or other format. And by looking up the
manual, we understand the actual details of the GPIO pin.

If dt-compiler had a option to support #define like in C, the numbers
could have been made more easier to understand. Like, 3 to mean
GPIO_PULL_UP in Exynos dts file.

Thanks,
Thomas.
