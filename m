Sahitya suggested to also check other error cases that mmc_blk_err_chec=
k
returns (such as MMC_BLK_CMD_ERR, MMC_BLK_ECC_ERR and MMC_BLK_DATA_ERR)=
=2E
I suggest to also check the exception bit in the status even if
mmc_blk_err_check returned success, since mmc_blk_err_check might not
catch all the packed commands failures. One example for such a failure =
is
when the header of read packed commands will have logical error.
