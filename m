I wonder whether just making this depend on either S3C_DEV_RTC, or simply
PLAT_SAMSUNG would just be a better choice.

The S3C_DEV_RTC would mean that the drivers the core of the kernel
would be built, but means that we can't speculatively build drivers
if the kernel hasn't any machines using them.

Making it depend on PLAT_SAMSUNG would mean it is available to all,
but would be selectable even if there isn't a machine supporting it
being built.

The current situation would mean that we have to update driver Kconfig
entries each time a new SoC turns up...

We could also have a HAVE_RTC_DRV_S3C so that all SoCs supporting this
coudl select it independant of whether there is machine support.

Anyone else got any comments?
