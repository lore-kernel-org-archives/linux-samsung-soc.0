Kukjin,

Sorry for the delay in responding--this thread started just as I was
walking out the door for vacation...

I guess this is OK, but personally I'd vote to remove the init
altogether unless there is a hardware bug on some versions of exynos
that requires that we init this.  The kernel couldn't care less about
what value the timer starts at, so even on systems where the MCT isn't
started by the bootloader this is just a waste of code.

Chirantan: can you post your patch
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/201143/> up?

Can you try again?  I think there may have been a glitch.  It's also
possible that your browser grabbed the "." at the end of the URL,
which would confuse things.
