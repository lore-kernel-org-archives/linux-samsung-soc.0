Actually I also preferred properties per one timing... but finally
agreed on simpler approach.

Adding new parameters to the array is still possible (because the order
matters) and removal as well (by ignoring some indices). All ARMv7
Exynos SoCs have exactly the same registers for SROM controller
(Exynos3250, Exynos4, Exynos5). On newer Exynos ARMv8 (Exynos5433 and
Exynos7420) I don't know because it is not documented.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
