Thanks for the hint! Yes, I should probably adjust this value when
doing more tests.

Well, like I said above, the HDMI doesn't seen to be affected by the low
MIF/INT clocks. I have tested this with 1280x720 here on my Odroid X2,
but I also have another user (with a U3 if I remember correctly) who
also confirms that HDMI is working in combination with devfreq and
simple_ondemand.

I guess it's just the G2D engine that doesn't like the low clocks. Maybe
it also affects the IPP subsystem, but I have no means to test this.


With best wishes,
Tobias
