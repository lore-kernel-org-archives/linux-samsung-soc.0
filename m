I just saw, there is another issue related to this. The driver should call
INIT_COMPLETION(&info->completion) before starting the conversion. Otherwise
there may be a problem if we got interrupted while waiting for the
interrupt. E.g. imagine the following sequence.

1) Start conversion
2) Wait for completion
3) Abort waiting
4) Interrupt kicks in and marks the completion as done

Now if another conversion is started the completion will already be
completed and wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() will return right
away without waiting for the conversion to be finished.
