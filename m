Most notably: the arch timer starts when MCT forward running counter
starts. Without kicking MCT, the arch timer seems to be frozen.

Unfortunately, I cannot confirm this, at least on Exynos5433 (ARMv8). I
played with arch and MCT timers on it and failed to get the
arch-timer-only setup working. I did not have access to newer Exynos
designs (Exynos 7) so I do not know how it works there.
