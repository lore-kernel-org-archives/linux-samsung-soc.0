The Rockchip-SoCs use something similar, so I'm following quite closely what 
Thomas is trying to do here, as similar solution would also solve this issue 
for me.

On some Rockchip-SoCs even stuff like pclk and hclk seems to be sourced from 
the divided armclk, creating additional constraints.

But on the RKs (at least in the upstream sources) the armclk is simply equal 
to the pll output. A divider exists, but is only used to make sure that the 
armclk stays below the original rate when sourced from the temp-parent, like

	if (clk_get_rate(temp_parent) > clk_get_rate(main_parent)
		set_divider(something so that rate(temp) <= rate(main)
	clk_set_parent(...)

Isn't there a similar possiblity on your platform, as it would remove the need 
for the safe-voltage?


In general I also like the approach of hiding the rate-change logic inside 
this composite clock, as the depending clocks can be easily kept in sync. As 
with the Rockchips the depending clocks are different for each of the three 
Cortex-A9 SoCs I looked at, it would be "interesting" if all of this would 
need to be done in a cpufreq driver.
