After Yadwinder feedback I searched for clock drivers that returned 0 when the
clock was not enabled/prepared and found for example drivers/clk/clk-s2mps11.c:


static unsigned long s2mps11_clk_recalc_rate(struct clk_hw *hw,
                                             unsigned long parent_rate)
{
        struct s2mps11_clk *s2mps11 = to_s2mps11_clk(hw);
        if (s2mps11->enabled)
                return 32768;
        else
                return 0;
}

s2ps11->enabled is set in the driver's clk_ops .prepare and .unprepare function
handlers and calls to clk_prepare and clk_unprepare also don't seems to invoke
.recalc_rate so I guess that driver is wrong as well and should just return the
clock rate unconditionally?

Thanks a lot for the explanation, I'll revert that change then and return the
clock rate unconditionally on the next version of the patch-set.

Best regards,
