In David Riley's original patch the example had 200:
    https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4784611/

In the ChromeOS 3.14 kernel tree I believe we're still using the old
patch (we still have /bits/ 8).  ...it looks like I'm the one who
originally added it to the veyron dts file and I set it to 200, so I'd
presume that I just copied the example and called it "good enough".

I'm sure the upstream dts just used the number from the ChromeOS 3.14 tree...

Note that the GPIO-restart definitely need to be higher priorities
than others in the system.  The two I know of off the top of my head
are the "dw watchdog" and the one in the CRU.  The "dw watchdog" has a
priority of 128 and so does the one in "rockchip/clk.c".  Hrm,
actually, the Rockchip-specific one should probably have its priority
bumped up since it seems better not to just randomly pick between
these two...
