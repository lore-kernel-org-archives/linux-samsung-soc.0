Changes since V3:
	- used existent fixed-clock binding for registering oscillator clock
	  as fixed rate clock as pointed by Tomasz Figa
	- Made some changes in wm8994 regulator nodes as suggested by Tomasz Figa
	- Separated out only adding i2s nodes and enabling sound support on smdk5420
	  into different patch set as they are dependent on on some of already posted
	  but not yet merged i2c, dwmmc, dma and audss clock controller patches on
	  Kukjin for-next branch.

Changes since V2:
        - Separated out driver side changes and dts changes in two
          patch sets
        - Added proper names for wm8994 regulators as commented by Mark
        - Moved common i2s nodes into the exynos5.dtsi
        - Added clock info in wm8994 node as requested by Mark.
        - Registered the 16.9MHz oscillator clock as fixed clock in the
          machine file. Right now no user of this clock but as Mark requested
          to add mclk info in wm8994 node, I added this part.

This patch set is dependent on the following i2c, dma and audio subsystem
clk controller patches.

This patch set is made based on Kukjin Kim for-next branch.
