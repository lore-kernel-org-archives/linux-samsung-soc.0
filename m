My pleasure.

Fair enough.

I did not see any mention of this in the cpufreq-dt driver binding
documentation, otherwise I would have tried going this route.

Do you have any references? I'd be happy to examine what would be
necessary to go this route although, being an independent contributor,
it may take time.

That sounds like a great direction going forward. However, I would still
kindly request that you consider this series.

The existence of future plans of course does not change the fact that
users have real hardware today; hardware that they have spent money on
and would like to use. Cpufreq support has already been deferred once
for similar reasons of interface churn which essentially forestalled
working functionality from entering the kernel by eight months; I'd
really like to avoid having this happen again.

Indeed.

Sounds reasonable to me. However, I'd just like to reiterate that this
line of work can be pursued independently from the upstreaming of this
series.

Thanks for your time,
