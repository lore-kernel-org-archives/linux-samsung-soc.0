Right, CCI snoops and DVMs for a cluster must be enabled by the first man
running in that cluster upon cluster power up with caches off, where the
first man must be arbitrated if multiple CPUs are racing for enabling CCI.
This is not an issue on cold boot, it is on resuming from CPUidle.

I really do not want to go there, but I might (apart from CCI PMUs).

Yes I do and I was willing to help implement it for TC2 to provide people
with an example on how to do it _properly_ (in secure world though, and that
was a mistake IMHO). If what we get is a workaround for every platform
going upstream, we are in a bind, seriously.

Whatever the outcome of this thread, a booting protocol update for CCI
is in order, even if we have to debate it for 6 months or more to get
an agreement.

I do not think they do. The kernel should not become a place where firmware
bugs are fixed, if you refuse to fix the bug and this code does not get
upstream I am pretty sure next time more attention will be paid.

Booting, powering up and down cores are standard procedures, why can't we
share the same code for all v7 platforms ? Why ?

And we are not talking about a race condition hit every 10 gazillions
cycles here.

If firmware messes up the DMC controller configuration, would you fix
it in the Linux kernel ? It is an unrealistic (well..) example but you should
catch my drift.

Where do we draw the line, that's my point.

Nicolas: it is not a matter of PSCI vs. MCPM, firmware vs. the kernel,
that's a debate worth having, not now.

There is a bug to solve, and you did. What I am telling you is that
I am fed up to my back teeth of having code in the kernel solving
issues that should not be solved in the kernel, if we keep doing that
hacks will become the rule not the exception. Time to draw a line,
firmware is broken, so is the platform. (BTW, if anyone can explain to
me how CPUidle works in this platform, and that's the main reason of
having MCPM in there, I am all ears).

Adding these hacks has serious maintainance consequences (eg CPUidle
code) and that's the main reason I jumped into this discussion.

Let me reiterate my point: it is not a kernel vs firmware debate, it
is about clean and maintainable code vs hackish and unmaintainable
code in the kernel.

And of top of that, people must test their code, we are not talking
about a rare race condition here, this is a blatant bug.

I have lots to add concerning the firmware implementations of power
down procedures, but let's take it offline.

I am not happy with merging your patch, I am sorry, for the reasons I've
just explained.
