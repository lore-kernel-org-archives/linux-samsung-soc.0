That's the grey area. :) I mean that instead of making these implemented
bindings an interface, they should rather be converted to standard
regulator bindings. However the device is quite old, not used on newer
boards, so there is no interest in improving this. In the same time
removal of this code is not strictly necessary. Its existence does not hurt.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
