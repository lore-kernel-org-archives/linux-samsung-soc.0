Hi Daniel,

The idea itself is quite good, but unfortunately I have to NAK this. Please 
see details in comments below.

Note the S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_IDLE flag here.

Note the S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_SLEEP flag here, which is different from 
the S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_IDLE flag above.

Finally note the S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_SLEEP flag here again.

I believe it should be visible now what's wrong with this patch. To make 
sure it is, let me explain how the system controller of S3C64xx handles WFI 
requests.

When the CPU issues WFI request to the syscon, it takes an action depending 
on how it is configured. A bit field is there in one of syscon registers 
(S3C64XX_PWR_CFG) that selects what action to perform in case of WFI 
request.

You can program the syscon to ignore the request, enter IDLE mode, enter 
STOP mode or enter SLEEP mode. As the names suggest, for cpuidle, it needs 
to be programmed for IDLE mode and for system-wide sleep it needs to be set 
to SLEEP mode. STOP mode is not very useful as it has mostly the same 
effect that can be achieved by performing fine-grained clock and power 
gating of peripherals manually, so it is unused by Linux.

Now, my take on the issue you are trying to solve would be a bit different. 
Since the S3C64xx does not have any interesting cpuidle modes, just a 
normal, clock-gated WFI mode, it does not need to have a cpuidle driver at 
all. All that is needed is simply setting up the S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI 
field to S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_IDLE early at boot-up, then set it to 
S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_SLEEP just before entering the sleep mode and 
restore it back to S3C64XX_PWRCFG_CFG_WFI_IDLE after waking up.

Best regards,
Tomasz
