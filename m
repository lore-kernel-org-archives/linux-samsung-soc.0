Yes, it makes more sense. Using old way of parsing regulators from DT i=
t
was straightforward.

However new DT style parsing (regulator_of_get_init_data()) does the
basic parsing stuff and this removes a lot of code from driver. The
driver no longer parses all regulaotrs but the regulator core does it.
Unfortunately regulator core does not parse custom bindings (like such
GPIOs) so I would have to iterate once again through all regulators jus=
t
to find "gpios" property.

It is simpler just to do something like (5 regulators can be controlled
by GPIO):

max77686_pmic_dt_parse_gpio_control(struct platform_device *pdev, *gpio=
)
{
  gpio[MAX77686_LDO20] =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "ldo20-gpios", 0);
  gpio[MAX77686_LDO21] =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "ldo21-gpios", 0);
  gpio[MAX77686_LDO22] =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "ldo22-gpios", 0);
  gpio[MAX77686_BUCK8] =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "buck8-gpios", 0);
  gpio[MAX77686_BUCK9] =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "buck9-gpios", 0);
}

These are new bindings. Driver exists but I am adding new functionality=
:
the "GPIO enable control".

Right, I haven't thought about conflicts.

Thanks! I'll adjust to new style.
