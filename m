So do you stop, setup and start the link with CPU, and this has to be
happen during blanking? Isn't that prone to errors? Or did you mean that
the hardware handles that automatically?

In OMAP DSS there are so called shadow registers, that can be programmed
at any time. The you set a bit (GO bit), which tells the hardware to
take the new settings into use at the next vblank.

=46rom DSI driver's perspective the link is never stopped when
reconfiguring the video timings. However, many other settings have to be
configured when the link is disabled.

Ok, I think I was being a bit vague here. I explained the OMAP DSI
routing not because I meant that this API is specific to that, but
because it explains why this kind of routing info is needed, and a
bitmask is not enough.

If you look at the omap_dsi_pin_config struct, there's nothing OMAP
specific there (except the names =3D). All it tells is that this device
uses N DSI pins, and the device's clk+ function should be connected to
pin X on the DSI master, clk- should be connected to pin Y, etc. X and Y
are integers, and what they mean is specific to the DSI master.

When the DSI master is OMAP's DSI, the OMAP DSI driver does the pin
configuration as I explained. When the DSI master is something else,
say, a DSI bridge, it does whatever it needs to do (which could be
nothing) to assign a particular DSI function to a pin.
