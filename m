You are missing concept of power domains in this picture. True,
subsystem knows when it probes but power domain does not. Subsystem has
no knowledge of power domain (devices in the same subsystem can come
from different domains).

We need to have either subsystem or device core to indicate to power
management core that we do not need "full" runtime resume, but rather a
"partial" one since driver is not ready yet.

We would not need new callbacks here I think, we just need to be able to
select appropriate set of callbacks, depending on the binding state.

Thanks.
