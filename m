Hi Mr.Jeon

One question...if we used predefined transfer, didn't send stop-command?
then i think that didn't need to enter this condition..how about this?

In __dw_mci_start_reqeust() function(at your patch)

if (mrq->stop)
	host->stop_cmdr = dw_mci_prepare_command(slot->mmc, mrq->stop);

If i misunderstood something, plz let me know...Thanks.
