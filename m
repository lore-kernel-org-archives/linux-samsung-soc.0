That's right, unfortunately. Interestingly enough AFTR worked fine on
Exynos4210 with this patch, but still this needs to be fixed.

Now, in fact, I recall that Chander had some objections to this patch as
well and we decided that he will send another patch to replace mine [1],
but I haven't heard from him since that.

Chander, do you have any progress with this? Keep in mind that we need
this as an rc fix and we already have rc5, so not much time left. If you
don't have time to work on this I can take care of this, proceeding as
we discussed in [1].
