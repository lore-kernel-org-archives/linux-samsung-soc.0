Many changes/fixes have been identified for clock file for exynos5420.
These include correct parents, bit fields, new clocks etc. Existing
files needs some correction in terms of names of the clock and
indentation. These issues are addressed in this patch series.

This patch series is rebased on,
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git:3.15-rc4

This patch is also dependent on the following patch.
clk: exynos5420: Add clock IDs needed by GPU
    -- http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg326461.html

This patch series is tested on Exynos5420 based peach-pit board.
    -- [PATCH v4 0/2] Add peach-pit board support

Clock Summary before and after applying this patch series:
----------------------------------------------------------
http://slexy.org/view/s2KMWxI3wv

As per Tomasz Figa's sugession, one more patch will be sent on
top of this patch series to remove the unnecessary clocks
related to GATE_BUS_* offsets.

Changes since v4:
-----------------
Addressed review comments from Tomasz Figa related to
CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT and CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED.

Changes since v3:
-----------------
Addressed review comments from Tomasz Figa and Alim Akhtar
Some of the changes includes,
1] Adding clock IDs for all the added gate clocks.
2] Followed bit ordering while defining new clocks.
3] Adding SET_RATE_PARENT flag for all the clocks having
   dividers as parents.

Changes since v2:
-----------------
1] Addressed review comments from Gerhard Sittig and Tomasz Figa.

Changes since v1:
-----------------
1] Addressed review comments from Tomasz Figa.
