I agree, I think it's a great improvement to get another official
maintainer of Samsung's platforms that can share the load and send us
code.

While I often also use the argument that anyone can help review code
without being named a maintainer, in the particular case of Exynos
platforms there's a dire need for more close attention: They're
frequently broken for long periods of time and there's been high
latency for fixes, which has made bisecting hard or impossible for new
failures. Naming Krzysztof as co-maintainer makes it more clear that
we're happy to merge code from him directly as appropriate for latency
reasons and so on.

So:
