Right now none dts of which I'm aware of doesn't define the power domain for
the parts of the SoC, which are always on and doesn't need any additional
management.

This was about Linux device core, which assigns device to its power domain
and ensures that the power domain is in right state during device probe and
then during device operation. Currently core supports only one domain per
device, so the question was which domain to chose if there are more than
one listed.

I don't think that using sub-nodes for describing details of the given
hardware block is something uncommon in DT. Please check pin control
or PMICs (especially regulator providers). Same for various "port"
sub-nodes often used by various video/display devices and bridges.

The above presented method describes well which sub-part of clock
controller is placed in which power domain.
