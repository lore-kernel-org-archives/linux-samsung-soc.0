Hi, All.

It seems too late that this patch-set is merged into linux-3.16.
Also there are some conflicts in device-tree. (I will remove the conflicts)
So if everybody is ok, I will rebase on linux-next after released linux-3.16.
At that time, i will send this patch-set to stable kernel, too.
how about?
And I want to know who can apply this patch-set(#3~#5).

Best Regards,
Jaehoon Chung
