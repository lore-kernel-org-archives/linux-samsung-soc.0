Hello,

This patch series adds support for Samsung S5PC110 SoC. S5PC110 belongs
to S5PC1XX family (CortexA8 ARM core), but differs in many places from
the S5PC100 SoC: new memory map, different clock hierarchy, new gpio
banks and much more powerful integrated peripherals. Such differences
cannot be easily handled in the current Samsung machine&platform
framework. To avoid duplication of code and adding yet another plat-*
directory, we decided to introduce sub-platforms in the current s5pc1xx
platform.

First 9 patches prepare s5pc1xx platform code for introduction of the
new sub-platform approach. Then in the next 11 patches all core
functions and drivers are subsequently added, so S5PC110 sub-platform
gets similar level of support as S5PC100. The last patch updated
MAINTAINERS information.

This patch series has been prepared against next-s5pc100-common branch
from Ben's tree ( git://git.fluff.org/bjdooks/linux )

I hope these patches would be accepted together with recent S5PC6440
patches, so we would be able to start working together on dev-table
support for all Samsung SoCs.

Changes since v2

S5PC110 code has been adapted for all Samsung platform framework changes
(clksrc and common irq support).

Changes since v1

The following issues reported by Ben have been fixed: gpiolib support has
been rewriten, more SoC specific files have been moved to mach-s5pc*
directories (gpio chip, plls and clocks definitions). Also author/sender
issues are resolved.

The clock issue in S5PC110 driver has not been addressed. The driver
uses clock API in the same way as it is handled in other Samsung UART
drivers. This clock issue should be resolved in a separate patch which
would fix all Samsung drivers at once. Until then we would like to use
the current approach.
