I looked at the DP and FIMD drivers and with great help of Andrzej
Hajda found the issue: the FIMD driver does not enable DP clock
(DP_MIE_CLKCON register). The process looks like:
1. Bootloader sets the DP_MIE_CLKCON to proper value.
2. FIMD is probed, DP power domain is on.
3. FIMD is deffered, DP power domain is turned off.
4. The FIMD registers are reset so DP clock is turned off.
5. DP driver is probed, DP power domain is turned on but clock is not enabled.

I'll do some more testing and sent a patch for it till end of Monday
so I think we should not revert this commit.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
