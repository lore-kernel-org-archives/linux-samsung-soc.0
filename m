OK. I'll modify it.

I use the DEVFREQ_TRANSITION_NOTIFIER instead of this implementation.

I agree. I'll implement again with notifier.

OK. I'll add the new notifier of DEVFREQ_TRANSITION_NOTIFIER
The list of supported notification:
	DEVFREQ_PRECHANGE
	DEVFREQ_POSTCHANGE

OK, I'll use DEVFREQ_TRANSITION_NOTIFIER for passive governor.
