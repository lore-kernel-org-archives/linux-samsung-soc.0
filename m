The usage strategy for the PRNGs registered at the kernel crypto API is as 
follows:

1. crypto_rng_alloc

2. crypto_rng_reset

3. crypto_rng_generate

If in step 2 you provide NULL as input, the kernel takes get_random_bytes as 
seed source. Step 2 is the mandatory.

The Linux-RNG can be fed internally from the hw_random framework by the 
function hwrng_fillfn. This function is only used if the current_quality or 
default_quality values in the hw_random framework is set.

For the TRNG, it seems to be not set per default, but could be set as either a 
boot argument or at runtime via /sys.

If that variable is set and the TRNG is registered, it feeds random data into 
the Linux-RNG which in turn is used per default to seed a PRNG. In this case, 
no detour via user space is needed to push data from TRNG to the PRNG. Using 
that mechanism allows you to benefit from additional entropy the Linux-RNG 
collects elsewhere.

Given the reasons above, I would think that keeping the PRMG and TRNG separate 
as offered by the current patch seems reasonable. If configured correctly, the 
TRNG can seed the PRNG at any time (including boot time) without the need of 
user space.
