Thanks for considering the scenerio. Yes, you are right and we need to
start somewhere.

Yes, thats right! The area not covered by the other framebuffer
device/window (e.g. fb1) will be transparent and the framebuffer
device/window below (e.g. fb0) will be visible.

This will need more discussions, as the amount of information to be
exposed to the user-space might vary from controller-to-controller.

This is already present. Switching on/off any particular framebuffer
device/window can be done by calling ioctl with FBIOBLANK, from user
space.

Yes, thats a good point. This can be achieved by implementing ioctl call

This seems to be more to do with the property of the FB controller.
Moreover, the driver can always enforce checks on such hardware
restrictions.

The user application should take care of these functions, as this is
directly related to the window size. (Usually these operations are
handled by some separate hardware modules (post-processors) )

Yes, having these missing features will definitely give the user much
more control over the various available framebuffer devices/windows.
We would like to start with the fb window re-positioning feature and
add more features in coming days.

Thanks for your review and suggestions. It was very helpful.
