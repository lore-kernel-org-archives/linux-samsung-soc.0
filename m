I guess waiting for you to send out v5 is a good idea, but as Kgene
mentioned it would be nice to have the series in arm-soc in order
to base other branches on top of it, and we have now made it possible
to update branches like this one by declaring them "staging".

The main advantage that I see of putting your series into arm-soc
is that I can handle the dependencies: If you want to update the
series based to v6 after more review and send me a replacement pull
request, I can rebase the exynos5 patches (and other conversions)
on top of that. If you have a different tree in linux-next and plan
to rebase it, I cannot take any other patches into arm-soc that depend
on yours.

The alternative would be that I take the exynos5 patches in their
current shape into arm-soc and you put your patches into linux-next
based on the branch that I have, and with a patch to convert exynos5
to it on top.

I did not mean the omap specific parts.
