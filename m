Hi All,

Well, i didn't find the James's error message.
But i confused about the clock value.

Bus speed : 99840000Hz
request   : 200000Hz
Div : 250

If bus_speed is divided with div, then actual value should be 399360Hz.
But this log is produced 199680Hz. What's wrong?

I think this message can be confused to debug.

Best Regards,
Jaehoon Chung
