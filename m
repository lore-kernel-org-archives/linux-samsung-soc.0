True..

We shouldn't be doing much at this stage. We operate on a channel, so the
channel is returned to the client. We need to do these HW configurations
when the channel has to be prepred for a txn.

Yes agreed on that, plus the runtime handling needs to be built in, right
now the APIs dont work well with it, we disucssed these during the KS and
this goes without saying, patches are welcome :)
