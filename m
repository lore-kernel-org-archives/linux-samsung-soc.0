Hi Sjoerd,

Thanks for the patch. I posted some comments inline, though.

IMHO it wouldn't be a bad idea to specify exactly what those
unexpected results are and why a manual update helps instead of
repeating the same thing that can be understood from reading the code.

nit: According to CodingStyle multi-line comments should start and end
with empty line, i.e.

/*
 * Line 1
 * Line 2
 */

nit: s/pwm/PWM/
nit: Missing dot at the end of the sentence.

This check looks really heavy weight and is not really obvious at
first look (especially the need to divide both sides by chan->tin_ns
to account for integer rounding). Maybe instead you could read back
tcmp before writing the new one and compare it with -1U?

Also nit (if you decide to keep the condition as is): There should be
spaces on both sides of the slash.

I would move out the contents of the if block above to a separate
helper function, e.g. pwm_samsung_manual_update().

Best regards,
