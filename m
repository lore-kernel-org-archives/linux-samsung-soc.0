You are welcome and thanks to you for pointing this out.

Indeed, in the meantime I will continue looking at this to better understand
all the interactions so if something breaks with your changes I may be able
to test / debug and hopefully fix it :)

Thanks a lot, Krzysztof who is one of the Exynos maintainers has also agreed
with the patch so hopefully this can land sooner rather than later.
