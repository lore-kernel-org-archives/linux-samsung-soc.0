I am inclined for this solution.

The state_count was initially in the device structure, then it has been
moved to the driver structure and the code has been changed accordingly=
=2E
That was part of the cpuidle code consolidation made by Deepthi Dharwar
(46bcfad7).

This patch is one step back.

There is an alternate solution. May be you can use the multiple driver
support to register two cpuidle driver (one for each cpus) ? It was
initially made to support cpus with different latencies but that should
work.
