Chris, Yeah, it is not in arm-soc tree now. Because I sent a pull 
request of samsung-mmc which is including this v3.4-for-cjb but Olof 
wanted to merge only arch/arm/ part for samsung mmc because they are not 
unrelated to the branch, v3.4-for-cjb sent to you. Since I thought the 
branch would be sent to upstream via your tree and you were included in 
the mailing loop, I agreed. So there is no it in arm-soc.

Yeah...it means not closed yet ;)

Hmm, I think, if you're ok, you can send a second pull request to Linus 
for it and actually, it is in linux-next for a long time via mmc and 
samsung tree.

Note, please don't rebase it because its resolution for conflicts is in 
linux-next and I think Linus will use it when happens conflicts...Or I 
can provide new tree on top of latest mainline. But I'm not sure about 
latter.

Yes, I already agreed its merging in the mmc tree :)

If any my effort is required, feel free to contact me.

Thanks.
