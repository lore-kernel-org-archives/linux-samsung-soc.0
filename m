This is unfortunate. I guess this was assumed to be implied by way of
the examples. :/

Agreed.

When I last tried I thought that required more complex parsing than
could be done with a regex.

That said, I'd forgotten that properties must come before child nodes,
so I though I had to at least balance '{' and '}' for children. I guess
all we need to do is find a line beginning with '\s*reg\s*=\s*<' before
the next '{' or '}'.

Maybe this will be easier than previously thought. :)

Mark.
