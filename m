There could be OF based Samsung platforms that might not need the
keypad controller driver to be compiled. And it could get selected for
non-samsung platforms using OF. So, this change would not provide the
intended dependencies.

The only concern with your patch was that Samsung keypad driver gets
listed even for non-samsung platforms. There is no particular
preference on this. But if you prefer to extend Samsung keypad
controller driver to other platforms as well, and if others agree,
that should be fine.

(Sorry for the delayed reply. I was out of office for three days.)

Thanks,
