I tested a Peach Pit (5420 based chromebook) with your patches and
they work well (temperatures and software tripping). However, my
earlier comments with regards to duplicate exynos_tmu_initialize() and
the thermal zone showing as disabled in sysfs .

Also, I think the documentation for the dt properties are missing ?

I will post my exynos7 work based on your patches soon. Please take a look.
