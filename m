Still, I think that some small code snippets illustrating the idea are 
really helpful.

Hmm? So, do you suggest to call phy_create() from board file? What phy_ops 
struct and other hardware parameters would it take?

There was a reason for introducing lookup solutions. The reason was that in 
board file there is no way to get a pointer to something that is going to be 
created much later in time. We don't do time travel ;-).

Well, to the point that I think I now understood your suggestion. 
Unfortunately the suggestion alone isn't really something that can be done, 
considering how driver core and generic frameworks work.
