You know the changes you want to do, you know the new architecture so
usually it is easier for you to figure out the split.
But few ideas:
1. For the problem of functions being deleted-moved without any
changes, you can try to reorder new code so diff will not show these
hunks. Indeed a lot diff here looks like weird matching of diff/patch.
This definitely has to be fixed because I cannot figure out the real
changes around existing functions (e.g. s5p_set_indata_start(),
s5p_aes_crypt_start()).
2. You add debugging code - FLOW_LOG - this is one candidate to split entirely.
3. Cleanups go to separate patch.

Probably working on (1) above will bring the most benefit.

For example:
- * @aes_ioaddr:        Per-varian offset for AES block IO memory
+ * @aes_ioaddr:        Per-variant offset for AES block IO memory

- * @tasklet:   New request scheduling jib
+ * @tasklet:   New request scheduling job

Seriously, you should not what you did in this patch, not me. There
might be more like this but it is difficult to find them out in
current patch.

Then nack for this parts. Your driver cannot in hidden way influence
any other driver, you should not reference to any other CONFIG_ from
within the code... The solution for this problem depends whether it
would be possible to have them working in the same time or not. IOW,
whether there is a conflict on registers or not.

Possible solutions:
1. In case of conflict: Add Kconfig dependency (negative dependency),
2. If they use the same registers but in non-conflicting mode, make
both drivers children of MFD driver with regmap-mmio shared between
them. IRQ could be handled by regmap_irq_chip.
3. Combination of 1+2 above: split out some generic RNG code from RNG
driver, implement the RNG also here (so there will be two RNG drivers)
and add !dependency between these two.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
