It _is_ possible today.

1. Arrange for individual DMA engine drivers to provide a filter
   function - eg, pl08x_filter_id() for pl08x channels.

2. Have the filter function check chan->device->dev->driver == its
   own struct driver as the very first thing, and reject on failure.

3. Have its own matching algorithm using whatever data is appropriate
   for the DMA engine driver.

4. Platforms (or SoC code) provide the match function plus match data
   via platform data to each driver.

That is essentially (except for (2)) how we deal with differing DMA
engine drivers with AMBA peripherals, and it seems to work remarkably
well.

You're quite clearly confused.  "DMA API" has not very much to do with
the subject we're discussing.  The "DMA API" is the API for mapping and
unmapping buffers for DMA.  It has not much to do with the DMA engine
API.  So I'm not going to bother trying to decode what you said above
until you start using the right terminology.  I'm a stickler for that,
get used to it.

No point talking about how round bananas are when you're actually
discussing orange fruit.

No.  For slave DMA, peripheral drivers normally need a specific
channel on the DMA controller.  Peripheral drivers normally do not
know which channel they need, or even which DMA controller they
require.  That information is specific to the platform and SoC.

So, returning the "first free channel that matches the capability"
is senseless - insane - for slave DMA.

What are these capabilities?

No.  You're being far too specific to your own DMA controller.  Many
DMA controllers (eg, PL08x) have a number of physical channels, all of
which can be programmed for M2M, M2P, P2M and P2P.  There is nothing
in the design which restricts what a channel can do.

So to put that as the basis for a generic match algorithm is absolutely
senseless.

There is absolutely no way that this will work in reality - are you on
a different planet?  As has already been described to you, MMCI can
use one DMA channel, and programs it according to the DMA direction,
and has in the past adjusted the burst size according to what's going
on with the driver.

With your model, it would have to claim N channels from the DMA
engine for all possible different configurations.

That's utterly unworkable and unrealistic.

So no, I don't think your idea of 'capabilities' is any solution.  It
just creates yet more problems - more than it solves.
