I don't mention that this patch is bug fix.

No. It is well working. There is no any know error. As I already said,
First is checking the return value of function call as following.

e is error or success.

I don't agree. As I already said as following, first is checking the
return value of function call as following.
">> When calling the function, basically we should check whether
return value is error or success."

I don't want you use 'dobious' word. I need correct reason why you do
obeject to use it.
The error checking is clear.

Do you have the performance result between regmap and __raw_readl/writel?
Do you mean that regmap-mmio is unneeded?

It is not reasonable. The system is enough fast to use the regmap. The
many device driver use the 'regmap-mmio.c' driver in mainline kernel.
You can find them.

When using devm_regmap_init_mmio(), the device driver don't need to
consider the 'iounmap' becaue it is automatically by framework. And
when using __raw_readl/writel to read and write the registers, they
check whether register is writable/readable is not.

The __raw_readl/writel don't consider them and support them.

I replied already why regmap interface is used.
