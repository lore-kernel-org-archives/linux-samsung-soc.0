I tested this on exynos5800-peach-pi, and noticed a few things.

First, since voltage scaling is not currently supported, the CPU cluster
regulators (vdd_arm, and vdd_kfc) have to be set at sufficietnly high
voltage to support all the OPPs, otherwise things will likely hang.  I
think you should include something like the patch below[1] in this
series as well.

Second, as with earlier versions of this series, I'm still seeing lots
of "wait_until_divider_stable: timeout in divider stablization" messages
coming out when running powertop.

Speaking of powertop, in the "frequency stats" tab, I'm not seeing 0%
time spent in all the P-states, so not sure what's going on there.  The
stats/time_in_state sysfs files under cpufreq seem to show the right
values, so I'm not sure what's going on with powertop there.
