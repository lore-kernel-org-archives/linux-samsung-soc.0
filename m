Well, that part was supposed to depend on the bus type.  For example, it
won't be unexpected for PCI drivers, because runtime PM is always enabled
for PCI devices (although it may be blocked as I described).

A problem arises if a power domain is used along with a bus type that doesn't
enable runtime PM for devices by default and drivers are expected to do that.
That could be addressed by powering up a PM domain (and bumping up its usage
counter) when adding a device to it and keeping it up until all of the devices
in it are runtime suspended, but then it also should be turned off eventually
if there are no drivers for any of those devices.
