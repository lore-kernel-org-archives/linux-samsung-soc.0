Ahh, I didn't pick up on that "esp isn't aligned" part.

That said, if %esp gets unaligned at some point, it's not clear
exactly when we should align it. An unaligned stack pointer will
continue to _work_ just potentially perform fairly badly.

But more likely, we picked the wrong frame value to begin with.

For example, maybe that decode_frame_pointer() logic really should
check not that the low bit in bp is set, but instead check that it's a
valid "unsigned long *" that has the low bit set.

IOW, the difference would be that instead of checking

        if (!(regs & 0x1))
                return NULL;

if would check

        if ((regs & (sizeof(unsigned long)-1)) != 1)
                return NULL;

but also maybe add logic to simply not trust a next frame pointer that
isn't appropriately aligned.

So I think adding PTR_ALIGN() there in the unwind dumper might be a
bit late. By that time it has already accepted what looks like a
garbage frame. No?
