It's not that new. It evolved over a long period of time probably starting
from where the buddy bitmap was moved into the page->flags to save space.
Over time, this assumptions became more strict. Anyway, this is neither here
nor there so lets not fall down that hole.

How so? I'd rather you didn't punch holes in the memmap allocated by sparsemem
at all.

Ok, that is a clear example, thanks.

Not wrong. It's fine as long as you're ok with some unnecessary memmap
being allocated. There is wastage of memory but functionally it'll be
fine with existing sparsemem and the assumptions it makes.

Obviously you're not ok with this wastage or this discussion would not even
be happening and with SECTION_SIZE_BITS=26, there is quite a bit of wastage.

I haven't worked it out but I would think that wastes more memory than having
the larger section with some memmap wasted so I'm not going to advocate it
even though it'd "work".

I haven't researched this so apologies if it turns out to be stupid but
I think the bit SECTION_MAP_LAST_BIT is actually unused and should be
safe to use. Has the option being considered of using this bit to mean
"section has holes punched in it". If set, the architecture must provide
an additional arch_holey_section_pfn_valid() that does additional checking
based on information sparsemem doesn't have?  This would avoid the worst of
the performance issues of making pfn_valid() slower without increasing the
size of mem_section.
