Hi Thierry,

I initially chose 'pci-' prefix such as 'pci-designware.c'.

However, Pratyush Anand suggested as below:
"I would suggest to rename it as pcie-designware.c,
because synopsis pcie and pci controllers are different."

If you have a good idea, please give it to me. :)
Thank you.

Best regards,
