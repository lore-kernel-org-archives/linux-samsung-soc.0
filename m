Hmm, okay... It is confusing because Samsung Semiconductors calls both
7420 and 5433 as "Exynos 7 Octa":
http://www.samsung.com/semiconductor/minisite/Exynos/w/solution/mobile_ap/7420/
The marketing uses term "Exynos7" for a generation of SoCs.

However if there is really a design called Exynos7 and a board with it
(Espresso), then I don't mind. Let it be Exynos7 but keeping in mind
that this is a specific SoC, not a calls of products.

That is additional argument in favor of "Exynos7" naming.

Thanks for explanation.

Exynos7 is fine. Thanks for the details!
