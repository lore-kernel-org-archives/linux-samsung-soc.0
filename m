No, GATE_IP_G2D is not in the exynos5x_gate_clks array so it looses
the kernel after a suspend/resume cycle.

I see, thanks for the clarification. Then I think that is a bug and
GATE_IP_G2D needs to be added to the list of clocks to be saved and
restored right? That's a separate issue from our current S2R problem
though so it can be done later as a separate patch.

No, the Chromebooks don't use secure firmware AFAIK.

Yes I noticed that the Exynos5420 driver also does the same but did not
want to do it there because I didn't know what value should had been used
for all the other clocks in the CLK_GATE_BUS_TOP register. But if I get
your explanation right, it is safe to do so since the register is going to
be reset to its default values anyways.

Yes, the following patch [0] is enough to make S2R working. If you think
that is correct then I'll post it as a proper patch then.

Subject: [RFC PATCH] clk: exynos5420: Restore GATE_BUS_TOP on suspend

Commit ae43b3289186 ("ARM: 8202/1: dmaengine: pl330: Add runtime Power
Management support v12") added pm support for the pl330 dma driver but
it makes the clock for the Exynos5420 MDMA0 DMA controller to be gated
during suspend and this in turn makes its parent clock aclk266_g2d to
be gated. But the clock needs to be ungated prior suspend to allow the
system to be suspend and resumed correctly.

Add GATE_BUS_TOP register to the list of registers to be restored when
the system enters into a suspend state so aclk266_g2d will be ungated.

Thanks to Abhilash Kesavan for figuring out that this was the issue.

Fixes: ae43b32 ("ARM: 8202/1: dmaengine: pl330: Add runtime Power Management support v12")
