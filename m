Yes, Client driver doesn't afflict the configuration data again.
So, I think spin_lock isn't required here.

For it, DMA machine code should include all header files of client driver that 
has definition of FIFO address.
The number of header file would be more than 10. And I think it make the code 
a little complicated.

Other DMA client drivers in mainline code already use SLAVE_CONFIG command to 
pass fifo address as following.
Please refer to Sound/soc/imx/imx-pcm-dma/mx2.c, Driver/mmc/host/mmci.c, 
Drivers/mmc/host/mxcmmc.c and so on.

And, Other DMA drivers also support to SLAVE_CONFIG command for it.
Please refer to amba-pl08x.c, coh901318.c, ste_dma40.c and so on in 
'driver/dma' directory.
So, In my opinion, this is proper method to handle the client's fifo address.
