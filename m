OK, fair enough.

OK, Vikas: do you want to code up the driver?

That's a neat concept and could be useful in other cases, but I think
it's just as much of a hack as using a regulator.  This is not a reset
signal for the TPM.  This is a signal that will mask the CPU's reset
signal (using a special bit of board-specific logic).


Personally I think Tomasz's idea of using hogs (after his patches
allowing a default output level) is the cleanest, but I think Stephen
didn't like that.
