Yes I thought of exactly similar clock setup, but was not convinced that it
should be part of OPP. In that case it looks like we are trying to represent
clock internals through some OPP bindings.

Yes I think its counter-intuitive as it's visible to the userspace(list of
frequencies and the boost parameters are exposed through sysfs)
