Gentle Ping.  Mike/Kukjin/Viresh could you please review/ack relevant
patches (patches #1-3 are for clock subsystem, patches #4-5 for Exynos
mach/dts and patch #6 is for cpufreq subsystem)?  Also what is your
preferred way to upstream them (patches are not independent so it would
be best to merge them through one tree, otherwise synchronization of
git pulls between different subsystem trees will be needed)?

I'm still hoping that this patchset will make it into v4.2 as there are
no known issues with it (except minor coding nit for patch #5)...

Best regards,
