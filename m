Ah, okay, thanks for details.

I see... Pankaj's driver was not developed for that purpose. You would
have to extend it. For the SROMC driver there shouldn't be much work to
do: just parse additional bindings and configure the controller for
ethernet adapter.

You are not bound by u-boot bindings anyhow (at least to my
understanding). You can try to re-use them but if some binding is
problematic then just create your own.
