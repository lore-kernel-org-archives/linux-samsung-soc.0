As it says in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/primecell.txt, you
should have "arm,primecell" and a value for the specific peripheral. It
should be in order of most specific to least specific.

What Linux uses currently from the binding is a bit irrelevant. The
binding is supposed to be future proof. An OS could choose to not use
the primecell ID at all and only match with compatible string.
