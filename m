No, let me explain you, property "samsung, syscon-phandle" referring back to 
it's own node
and I am not using platform_driver model for PMU driver are not related with 
each other.

We added "samsung, syscon-phandle" property to PMU node, as current syscon API's 
to get regmap
such as "syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle" expects "property_name" to lookup for 
proper device_node
which has regmap. So if we are passing PMU device_node to such API we should 
have that property under
PMU device node. So even though it's looking strange I do not think it's wrong.

But still since, you pointed out I checked syscon APIs carefully and found that 
we can avoid such property
which refers back to itself if we modify syscon APIs and allow them to accept 
"property" parameter as NULL,
assuming that device_node passed itself has regmap handle, following 
modification worked for me and if
it is acceptable I do not need to add such property in PMU device node.

==========
struct regmap *syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle(struct device_node *np,
                      const char *property)
  {
      struct device_node *syscon_np;
      struct regmap *regmap;
-
-    syscon_np = of_parse_phandle(np, property, 0);
-    if (!syscon_np)
-        return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
-
-    regmap = syscon_node_to_regmap(syscon_np);
-    of_node_put(syscon_np);
-
+
+    if (property) {
+        syscon_np = of_parse_phandle(np, property, 0);
+        if (!syscon_np)
+            return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
+
+        regmap = syscon_node_to_regmap(syscon_np);
+        of_node_put(syscon_np);
+    } else {
+        regmap = syscon_node_to_regmap(np);
+    }
      return regmap;
  }
=============

Other problem as you are seeing that current patch does not uses platform_driver 
model for PMU
is because PMU device node has two compatibility string and "syscon" driver is 
getting registered as
core_initcall, much before PMU registration. So only "syscon" driver's probe is 
getting called. So it does
not depend whether we have this property in PMU device node or we do not have.

I do not understand you here. Will you please explain a bit more here?

How come two driver with same ".name" can be registered? I can see if "syscon" 
driver
registration comes first, static registration from PMU driver, with same .name 
will fail.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

Your suggestion 1.a) worked well and I modified and tested it also.
So probably I can send that patch separately. Even though I can't see this 
helping me to convert PMU
as platform_driver model.
