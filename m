No worries, I have to re-spin anyways to fix the 17v typo that Doug pointed out.
But basically is related to our previous discussion in patch:

"[RFC 3/5] regulator: core: Only apply constraints if available on list voltage"

where you explained [0] to me that child regulators should explicit set their
constraints instead of getting from its parent supply. So this patch adds the
needed constraints for the children FETs even when their output voltage depend
on its parent supply.

Yes, the commit message is not great to say the least. Also I didn't have the
last version of the documentation so I misunderstood from where the constraints
mentioned in the schematics came from. Will fix the commit message when posting v2.

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
