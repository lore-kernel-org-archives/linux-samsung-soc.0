The s3c24xx SoCs contain one (or two) main interrupt controllers. That are =
the =

nodes that gets checked by handle_irq. Additionally they contain something =

called a sub-register which provides more specific irq for some of them.

The list you quoted, is meant to describe which bits of the interrupt regis=
ter =

contain a valid interrupt at all (!=3D 0), which handler should be used (2 =
for =

the edge handler, 3 for level handler). The second argument contains the bi=
t =

in the parent interrupt register that contains the parent interrupt, that g=
ets =

checked in the irq_entry function.

The original code (which I reworked into this more declarative form) =

distinguished very much between using the edge handler for some and the lev=
el =

handler for other interrupts.

This list is essentially the same representation of the list you quoted abo=
ve =

and which also can be found in [0]

Going this way makes it easy to map datasheet values to interrupt number. W=
hen =

I read the ac97 interrupt is in bit 28 of the sub-register I can simply =

reference it as
		interrupt-parent =3D <&subintc>;
		interrupts =3D <28>;


So these lists only desribe the internal structure of the interrupt control=
ler =

registers, which vary for each s3c24xx variant.

I'm not sure I can follow currently :-)

I'll try an example:

The s3c serial driver expects the interrupts for uart tx and rx and the dt =

entry would look like:

	serial@50000000 {
		compatible =3D "samsung,s3c2410-uart";
		reg =3D <0x50000000 0x4000>;
		interrupt-parent =3D <&subintc>;
		interrupts =3D <0>, <1>;
	};

the map for these in the subintc looks like
               s3c24xx,irqlist =3D <3 28 /* UART0-RX */
                                  3 28 /* UART0-TX */
                                  3 28 /* UART0-ERR */

marking them as using the level-handler and being children of the interrupt=
 in =

bit 28 of the intc handler.

So the irq_entry would check the intc, see the waiting interrupt in bit 28, =

jump to the demux function which would then handle which ever of rx,tx or e=
rr =

would be waiting, which then get sent to the serial driver.

These mappings between sub- and parent irqs also vary very much between the =

different s3c24xx variants, as can be seen by the multitude of lists in [0] =

and the parent interrupts are only used for demuxing purposes.

-----
A notable speciality are the AC97 (sound) and watchdog interrupts (bits 27 =
and =

28 of the subregister), as they share a common parent interrupt (bit 9 of t=
he =

main interrupt register).

So irq_entry checks the main register, sees bit 9 (ac97/watchdog), demuxes =
it =

to either coming from the ac97 or watchdog and sends it to the relevant =

driver.

I don't think this should be exposed to the drivers at all :-) .
-------

So I'm not sure, how this would be able to go in the driver nodes.


The only thing I could think of, would be to make the handler adjustable vi=
a =

the regular interrupts properties (i.e. as two_cell) which would bring the =

list down to only list the parent relationships.

Hmm ... and this parent list might be doable via the regular interrupts =

property, so the subintc would look like:

subintc: subintc =3D {
	interrupt-parent =3D <&intc>;
	interrupts =3D <28 0>, <28 0>, <28 0>, <23 0>, <23 0>, .....
	/*		     bit0    bit1    bit2    bit3    bit4   ..... */
}

i.e. naming the parent interrupt for each of the interrupt bits of the sub-
controller. Would this be the right direction?
