If these boost mode operating points are not generally advisable for use
as the other operating-points are, then they should IMO been in an
entirely separate property exclusive of (but in the same format as) the
operating-points property, e.g.

operating points = <A B>, <C D>;
boost-points = <E F>;

Otherwise, without boost-mode support we have to parse the boost mode
table to figure out which points to avoid. Or if someone typos a value
in either table we might go into a boost mode when we didn't want to!

Cheers,
Mark.
