It's a very good point.

I did away with "my" culprit at one point in
commit c00def71efd9
"ARM: ux500: simplify secondary CPU boot"
so people could look at that for an example to see how pointless
this "pen holding" (what does it even mean, I never figured it
out?) and boot_lock is.

I thought it was just a few platforms around the time the first
SMP systems were arriving that were doing this but as you point
out, recent newcomers are doing this, such as sti, actions,
qcom, hisi, sunxi.

I would encourage other platforms that have this "write some
magic stuff in some register to boot cpu n" to look at
arch/arm/mach-ux500/platsmp.c, something like that should be
all you need, no special assembly, no "pen", no "boot lock".

Look up resources etc in .smp_prepare_cpus(), make sure to
call set_cpu_possible() for each available CPU, then  just
kick in the CPU n in .smp_boot_secondary() by doing your platform
magic. Optionally cpu_die()
if you need special code or just put in a wfi() for that. That's all.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
