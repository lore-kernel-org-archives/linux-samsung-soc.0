I've also done some more testing. First I tested on some Exynos4412 devices
(M0 and SLP_PQ) and AFTR was not working on them. Then I got my hands on
Origen Exynos4210 (thanks to Tomek Figa for providing it) and AFTR is working
just fine on it. Finally I tried Trats board again but with the upstream
u-boot instead of our custom modified version (thanks to help from Lukasz
Majewski) and I found out that after this change AFTR works fine on it! It
also gives quite nice power savings (~80mA less current drawn in AFTR mode
compared to just WFI one).

With the above findings it now seems that the issue is on our side and is
outside the kernel. Thanks for help with narrowing down the problem and
sorry for wasting your time.
