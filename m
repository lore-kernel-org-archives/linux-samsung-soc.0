The fixed-clock binding requires the #clock-cells property to be present 
with value of <0>. It is not a valid fixed-clock otherwise.

Only clocks with active parents set to missing ioclocks will be 
orphaned. If a mux has an ioclock as its default parent, it can be still 
reconfigured to another input normally.

I believe ioclocks should be registered properly using DT, only if 
present. It is important, because such ioclock might not be an always-on 
fixed rate clock, but instead a configurable external clock generator.
