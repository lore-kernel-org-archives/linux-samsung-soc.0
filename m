OK.

OK, I will update it.
Other bits in dev->hash_flags can be set and cleared only in BUSY state.

It will make code ugly, using &dev->hash_flags[0] instead of &dev->hash_flags.
I have 9 bits used, and I will not anticipate it grow above 64.
If you insist, I can add DECLARE_BITMAP and rewrite all calls to _bits()
functions.

You are right, I will make samsung_aes_variant const again.

somewhere here will be (in Thread #2):
			if(test_bit(HASH_FLAGS_BUSY,dd->hash_flags)) {
					unlock, return; }

I can add spinlock as I am not 100% sure if below is true:

HASH_FLAGS_BUSY is protected by order of instructions and by test_bit.
First, this bit is set only in one place, in s5p_hash_handle_queue() and cleared 
also only in one place, s5p_hash_finish_req().

In function s5p_hash_handle_queue(), after spinlock, bit HASH_FLAGS_BUSY
is tested and if set, there is unlock and exit, and the flow reaches next
instructions only when this bit was not set. Setting bit is in the same spinlock
section, so as you write, concurrent calls to s5p_hash_handle_queue are
protected by spinlock.

There are some fields set in this struct before HASH algorithm registration
(in _probe()). I will try to avoid aes code moves.

Thank you, I will add this option to my process.
