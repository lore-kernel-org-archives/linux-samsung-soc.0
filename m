First we would need to learn the Exynos power domain driver to honor
"status=disabled" property, because right now it instantiate all domains
regardless the provided status ;) Feel free to prepare a patch for that.

I'm also not sure if driver core will handle such case properly. I remember
that it deferred probing of all devices when no power domain driver was
available, but this might be a bit different case than skipping domain
registration.

I think I've already tried to keep them sorted by address, but maybe while
rebasing/updating/fixing something went wrong.
