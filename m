Perhaps. The issue is whether common or driver specific code handles
this may change over time. In other words, it is purely a kernel
decision. It could move in either direction. It may be better to just
have a whitelist of devices (though it would need to be board specific
somehow).

I'd argue the generic case is just enable all the ones defined. If you
only need to deal with some of them or need a specific sequence, then
it is not generic.
