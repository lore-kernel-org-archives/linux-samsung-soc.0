This was debated a bit on the gpio-keys binding.  The binding *must*
specify where it is getting the keycodes from.  For the gpio-keys
binding, it was decided that the Linux keycodes were sufficient since
they are exported to userspace, and therefore part of the stable
kernel ABI (they will never change).  "keypad,key-code" is completely
useless as a generic binding since it doesn't specify where the
keycode meanings come from.  Besides, "linux,code" can be reused on
non-linux platforms too, it just means that the authoritative source
of the keycodes is the Linux kernel.
