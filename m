Right.

Ok. So the only downside I can think of for this is that it uses a slightly
less efficient format with additional padding in it. The kernel side will
be a little ugly as I'm trying to avoid defining a generic timeval64
structure (the generic syscalls should not need one), but I'll try to
implement it first to see how it ends up.

Thanks, good idea. I'll be at the kernel summit, but don't plan to attend
the media workshop otherwise. If you let me know about the schedule, I can
come to this session (or ping me on IRC or hangout when it starts).
