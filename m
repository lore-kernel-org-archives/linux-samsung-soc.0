I haven't said that either. I'd just like to know in what state this
series is in case of those SoCs. However, if there are stability issues
on them, there is also a chance that the same is true for other boards.

Anyway, we're early in releasy cycle, so probably we could get better
test coverage with this series in linux-next.

Kukjin, Viresh, how would you want to proceed with merging it? It
touches mach-exynos, cpufreq and samsung-clk, so it is non-trivial to
merge. However as far as I can see the cpufreq-related changes are just
a number of full file deletes and minor Makefile/Kconfig updates. It
will be more difficult with mach-exynos changes, as they are more likely
to produce conflict.

The only solution that comes to my mind is that I first apply patches 1
and 2, create a stable branch for Kukjin, then he applies patches 3, 4,
and 5 and creates a stable branch for me, on top of which I apply patch 6.

Best regards,
Tomasz
