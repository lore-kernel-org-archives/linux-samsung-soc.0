Yup, this is an expected behavior, unfortunately.  This was talked
about extensively during the review of this patch series.

I believe that patch #3 in Yuvaraj's series would fix your problem.
Specifically <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4763891/>.


The current summary of this issue is (Ulf, please correct me if I got
anything wrong):

1. If nothing else, Yuvaraj's patch should probably be split in two.
One half should be the MMC core half that I originally sent Yuvaraj.
I just rebased and re-uploaed it at
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/220560> in case you're
curious.  The second half should be the dw_mmc piece that Yuvaraj
wrote.

2. Ulf has indicated that he thinks that the MMC core change (and thus
Yuvaraj's patch) is ugly and not necessary.  He advocates instead
using the MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL on all affected platforms.  That means
we'll turn on the power every second, check for the card, then turn
off power.

3. I'm still of the opinion that the MMC core change isn't _that_
ugly.  Given that there are a large number of systems affected (across
at least two SoC vendors) and that it would be nice if those systems
didn't have to poll, I'd still be happy if the MMC core change could
go in.  ...but I'm a pragmatist and know that the polling isn't
_terrible_, so if that's the way we need to go then so be it.

--

My understanding was that Yuvaraj was going to spin his patch to use a
similar type of scheme to autodetect affected SoCs (looking for SoCs
known to have this problem where the platform data shows them using
the built-in card detect) and then enable MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL.  I
haven't seen a patch from him, so maybe you could post this up?

Note: the reason why exynos5250-snow and some other boards aren't
affected yet is that the regulator is simply not specified in the
device tree (it's just left always on).
