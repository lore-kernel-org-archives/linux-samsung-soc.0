Thanks Will for reviewing this patch series.

I tried building dw-mmc, dw-mmc-pltfm and dw-mmc-exynos as modules
with section mismatch debugging enabled, and there were no warnings.
But, I did find a problem with the Kconfig entry I made for
dw-mmc-exynos file, instead of 'bool', I should have used 'tristate'.
I will fix this and other comments and repost.

Thanks,
Thomas.
