Well, that clearly fell off my radar, sorry about that.

The idea, roughly, is that if there is a single on/off switch acting
on multiple devices, you can (a) set up a PM domain tracking all of
those device's runtime PM invocations and (b) maintaining a reference
counter of devices still not suspended.  This way it would only turn
the switch off when all of the devices in question had been suspended.
Analogously, it would turn the switch on before resuming the first
device in the domain.  Of course, that code isn't available as a
library, you would need to implement it (or use genpd, but chances are
it is too heavy weight for the job).

In theory, it shouldn't really matter where the switch is and how it
is operated as long as the PM domain "driver" knows how to access it.
However, for that to work something would need to bind that "driver"
to the domain and something would need to know which devices needed to
be added to the PM domains during enumeration and the ordering of
things bringup matters a lot here, which is a problem.

So in short, you are right that for the GPU/HDA thing device links
would likely to be a simpler to use and still get the job done.

Thanks,
Rafael
