I don't remember noticing the of_find_device_by_node or platform_device_alloc
in earlier versions of this patch, but that could just be me failing to
read it right.

I think this should get removed: it would be much better to ensure that
the regmap code can work without a device pointer, which I thought it
did. We should probably also skip the creation of the debugfs directory
in that case.

I think we first need to resolve the question of the platform device.
