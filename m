May be my commit is not explaining the requirements completely and the
API name may not reflect the relevance. But If you see the 3rd patch
it has one clock use-case where this new feature is used and the
current pm runtime feature is not sufficient enough to handle it. I
have one more IOMMU use case also which is not part of this patch
series.
I am not sure if this approach is final but I looked at runtime.c file
and it has couple of API's like pm_runtime_forbid/allow which
blocks/unblocks the runtime callbacks according to driver requirement.
In the similar line I added this new API.

my fault. Will update in next version.

yes to some extent. But I thought its purpose is different so I added 1 more.
