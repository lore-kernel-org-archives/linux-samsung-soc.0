My natural tendency would be to filter everything, as we certainly don't
want the device to be reconfigured in weird and fancy ways (my PCI-foo
is a bit limited, so bear with me). But as usual, GICv3 is not PCI
specific, and is designed to cater for weird and wonderful cases, PCI
being only one possible implementation...

On a non-PCI system, you definitely could assign a MSI-like capable
device, and let the guest do its thing. I'm already seeing that kind of
design.

It is not that simple. You could design things around a global ITT,
pointed to by all the possible devices in your system. But that table
would be quite big (it has to contain the routing information for all
the possible messages in your system, and must be physically
contiguous). You still need to know the devices (requester-id,
device-id, whatever), as there is no wildcard mechanism.

Also, this approach pretty much kills hotplug (you cannot easily resize
that table to add new interrupt entries). That's why I've opted for a
more dynamic configuration, where each device gets its own ITT as it
appears on the system.
