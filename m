Ah, I see what you mean. Do you want me to respin?

Alas, the attach/detach functions are generally not called from the same
level. After the bridge has been attached to an encoder, it is detached
in the generic code shutting down the encoder, i.e. the bridge consumer
is not explicitly involved with bridge detaching.

So, even though there is no _detach call, it is still not "missing" as
it is not supposed to be there...
