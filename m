Yes, it can be changed. Those rate/topology restoration should be done
in exynos5420 clk driver, which should also implement runtime PM.
However there is still one issue to be resolved. Current runtime
PM / generic power domains bindings doesn't allow to assign a device
(clock controller in this case) to more than one power domain. To
get it working we would need to have a clock controller object
(subdevice?) for each power domain.

Such approach has been already rejected by You in the initial Exynos4
clock controller runtime PM patches.

Exynos4 case could have been modeled in a different, frankly speaking
a bit more close to real hardware details. Exynos4 ISP clocks
registers (that part which is in fact under power domain) are in
separate address space region, so this in the end has been modeled
as separate clock controller, which was easily assigned to respective
power domain.

Exynos5420/5422 (also partially Exynos5250) is much more problematic,
because registers of all clocks are mixed together and MUXes which
loose state after power domain suspend are in common register
(SRC_TOP3). It cannot be modeled with multiple clock controllers, one
per each power domain.

I would like to avoid this if possible.

One thing to notice is locking granularity. CCF have a single,
common mutex with non-standard semantic (thread re-entrant), while
genpd has a standard per object mutex.

Changing CCF to use per-clock mutex instead of global prepare lock
will probably solve the possible dead-lock, but it will not make
deplock happy, because deplock doesn't distinguish object instances.

CCF locking scheme already suffers from the other issues, like long
waiting on common prepare lock and possible AB-BA deadlocks, which
were mentioned in the "clk: Add per-controller locks to fix
deadlocks" thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/8/16/442

I thought the we will be able to continue that work, but sadly there
were other more urgent issue to resolve first.

After some more thoughts about that patchset, it should be quite easy
to switch to per-clock mutexes (instead of per-controller/per-provider).
This would however not solve all the discussed issues.
