All my s3c24xx work is done is my spare time, so I have to confess I came u=
p =

with this "ugly patch" all by myself when working on dt support for my mach=
ine =

and stumbling upon the described problem with the pin configuration.

So, as it is obviously wrong, I also won't hold onto it.

In any case, thanks for the thorough explanation, which I probably won't =

forget anytime soon.
