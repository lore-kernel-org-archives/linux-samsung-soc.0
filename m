What do you mean by "AFTR doesn't work" ? Is the kernel hanging ? The
state is never reached ?

The cpu enters the idle mode with the interrupts disabled.

I have an Origen 4210 board Ver A. and it works without problem with th=

AFTR mode (cpu1 unplugged).

It works forme with a vanilla kernel 3.10.0-rc7.

Removing a feature because it seems not working is not a good solution.
The right way is to investigate what is happening and why.
