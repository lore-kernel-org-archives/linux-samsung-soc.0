You can find the detail from:

[PATCHv7 09/12] iommu/tegra: smmu: get swgroups from DT "iommus="
  http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2013-December/007212.html

You can specify any parameters which your iommu requires from a device,
and a device(master) can have multiple IOMMUs.

 	device@... {
 		iommus = <&iommu [spec]>[, <&other_iommu [other_spec]>...];
 	};
