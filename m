OK, I'll re-order the sequence of patchset and modify minior issues about your comment.
Also, I'll modify the patch description for patch8.

I don't understand correct your meaning.I explained DT support on upper
patchset description by using DT helper function and I added PPMU descritpion.
Also, Each patch include detailed description of patch content.

What is more needed?
