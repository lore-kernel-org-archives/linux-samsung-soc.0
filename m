Yes, but only some of the data can be discarded.  Continuing with the
example in hand, while you can discard the six words which represent
samsung_keypad_platdata, but the keymap_data can't be because that won'=
t
be re-allocated, which is probably a much larger data structure.

So, samsung_keypad_platdata can be marked with __initdata, but the keym=
ap
data must not be - and this is where the confusion about what can be
marked with __initdata starts - and eventually leads to the keymap data
also being mistakenly marked __initdata.

Is saving six words (or so) worth the effort to track down stuff
inappropriately marked with __initdata ?  I'm sure there's bigger savin=
gs
to be had in other parts of the kernel (such as shrinking the size of
tcp hash tables, reducing the kernel message ring buffer, etc) if size =
is
really a concern.
