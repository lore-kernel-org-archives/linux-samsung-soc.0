OK. I'll move it at drivers/devfreq/exynos directory.
Do you prefer 'exynos-bus.c' instead of 'exynos-busfreq.c'?
If you reply, I'll change it.

OK, I'll add new property for saturation_ratio.

I'll implement to use default saturation_ratio value ,
if dt node don't include saturation_ratio property.

OK, I'll modify it.

Thanks for your review.
