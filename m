Ok. Maybe I have an older manual then. I will change it to 3-bit for 4412.

Ok. Thanks for the information. I will add divisor support for Exynos4
as well. These patches have not been tested with Exynos4 since I do
not have a Exynos4 based board that uses dw-mmc controller.

Ok. I will remove the optional value and make this property mandatory.

Thanks,
