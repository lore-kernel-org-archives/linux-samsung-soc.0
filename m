Well, it will eventually have to be moved somewhere else than it is, but I 
believe this will have to wait for Common Display Framework.

This is because the case of MIPI DSI is slightly different from 
DisplayPort, since it is not an enumerable/auto-configurable interface and 
requires dedicated panel drivers and static data provided by board 
designers (in DT for example). Handling of such things in a generic way 
will be done by CDF.
