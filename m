Separate sleep state is needed because of the pin control bindings and 
design.

A separate sleep state is required to let pin control client driver (in 
this case
Exynos I2S driver) let to choose when it is okay to switch pads into sleep
state and I see no other way to achieve this.

I agree that it would be possible to get rid of "samsung,off-state" 
property and
just detect off state when func/pud pair matches power down func/pud.

Maybe I wrote the description with a view too limited to the kernel 
operation
perspective, but if we remove the need to mark state as off, the above 
description
will not be needed.
