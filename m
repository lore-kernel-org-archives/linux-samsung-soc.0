The SATA physical layer controller is both a platform device and a i2c
slave device.
This compatible string is for the i2c client driver. Hence I have used
i2c-phy here.

As mentioned earlier SATA physical layer controller is both a platform
device and also an i2c slave device.
This Node is for the SATA physical layer platform device, the previous
node is for i2c slave device.
Certain initialization settings done directly and other settings has
to be done through i2c.

Yes, its a unique i2c controller which lacks an interrupt line while
others are interrupt driven.
Hence I have used a distinct compatible string for the driver to
distinguish the controller.

I will incorporate the other comments and resubmit the patch. Thanks.
