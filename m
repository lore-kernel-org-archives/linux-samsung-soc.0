Cool.

I am not sure if this driver should be deciding which clock is 'best' f=
or it.
Because ...
1) Usually it's the board designer who decides which clock to run at
 what speed based upon target device. So ideally, based upon use-case
the driver should simply get the 'best' clock from board via platform i=
n a
format that is compliant to the 'generic clock api'.
2) We are not changing source clock rates(and we should not).
 So the 'best' clock found, might still be way off in accuracy. And whe=
n we
can't anyway guarantee accuracy, why not leave the decision to
the board designer who might, say, select the source clock good enough
to be useful to more than one controller yet not absolutely accurate fo=
r any ?
3) It keeps enabled 3 unused clocks all the time.

Btw,

 #define MAX_SPI_BUS_CLK 4
 #define MAX_PSR 256

is safe ... even safer than with two on!
