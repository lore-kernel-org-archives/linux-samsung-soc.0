Subject: [PATCH] ARM: s3c24xx: Remove empty gta02_pmu children probe
Date: Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:13:10 +0200
Message-ID: <20180813151310.21960-1-krzk@kernel.org>
Return-path: <linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
To: Kukjin Kim <kgene@kernel.org>, Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>, Russell King <linux@armlinux.org.uk>, linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org, linux-samsung-soc@vger.kernel.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: linux-samsung-soc@vger.kernel.org

Since commit 67e67df8da72 ("gta02: Use pcf50633 backlight driver instead
of platform backlight driver.") the list of gta02 pmu children is empty
therefore looping through it and adding devices is a no-op.

This also fixes the GCC v8.1 W=1 warning:

    arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/mach-gta02.c: In function 'gta02_pmu_attach_child_devices':
    arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/mach-gta02.c:538:16: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false [-Wtype-limits]
      for (n = 0; n < ARRAY_SIZE(gta02_devices_pmu_children); n++)
                    ^
