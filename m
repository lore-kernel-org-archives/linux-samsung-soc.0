That would be kind.

Patches 2-3 in spring v3 should be non-functional snow refactorings for
you to consider, but untested by me; patch 1 you could skip if you
modify patch 2, if necessary. As for patch 4, you can see from my
spring-next branch [1] how I am successfully testing it with a TEST_ONL=
Y
patch: For simplefb usage I comment out the /dp-controller node to avoi=
d
drm/exynos detection (not enabling the driver in the user's .config
would be an alternative); when I run into issues with the drm during
testing, I can usually ssh in via USB ethernet/wifi.

In the dmesg for drm/exynos bridge series testing [2] (which I guess is
not gonna hit 3.17 any more?) I noticed that the USB3503 /usb-hub node
new in v3 is not working yet (complains about lack of #gpio-cells, I
guess for my reset-gpios property), not sure how to fix, so we/you coul=
d
probably just drop that node - preparing to test that now.

As for the rest of patch 4, it's a new DT, so we could fix up any
remaining bugs during 3.17 RC cycle, if it looks sane to you guys now. =
I
had replied to two series - namely cpufreq [3] and dwmmc [4] - where
merge conflicts might arise. Let me know if you need a respin for anyth=
ing.

Andreas
