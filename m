Circular buffers are nice from the point of view of allowing you to
(providing the hardware supports it) totally disable the periodic audio
interrupts and leave the system to run for very long times off the
normal system timers.  This gives a small but non-zero power benefit
providing the hardware gives you enough information about where the DMA
is so you can find out if you need to mix in a notification, otherwise
you get obvious latency issues.

You can also do this with an circular chain of sequential buffers of
course.
