Yes, your branch works fine, but it's because of the last (unposted)
patch on your branch[1]: 
ARM: dts: remove all supplies sourced from tps65090 PMIC

That patch had not been posted, so I hadn't seen it before, but based on
the changelog, it's pretty clear you had the same problems that I had
without it, so I'm not sure why it wasn't mentioned earlier in this
thread.

I also noticed that the "force vdd_arm and vdd_kfc to max voltage" patch
is not actually using the max voltage, which appears to be 1.5V from the
DT, but actually using 1.35 V, however the changelog has no explanation
for this.

One other thing, your temp-cpufreq branch has conflicts with max77802
stuff in the v3.17-rc1 branch of the exynos-reference tree (which I'm
using for CPUidle dependencies, on the PMU series IIRC.)

Are there any plans to update the main referece branch and include
cpufreq?

Kevin
