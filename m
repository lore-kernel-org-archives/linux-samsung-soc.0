Firstly thanks for taking time to include OMAP this time. Even if the
changes are not tested, we can get them working with necessary fixes.

Have looked at your series briefly and have some comments for the same.
Am planning to test these patches, but it might take bit more time.

Will update the results as soon as I have them.
