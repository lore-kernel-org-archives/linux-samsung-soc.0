Hi Alex,

Well, all the LEDs can be controlled from userspace. The default trigger
is just the initial setting, which can be changed later by userspace.
It's just a general comment, not an issue with the patch, though.

Anyway, you don't need such detailed patch description, as you can see
most of the things directly from the code. In case of this patch, just the
list of supported peripherals is fine, without going into minor details,
such as LED triggers.

Also, please see my comments inline.

style: A blank line should be separating properties from nodes.

Are the labels for this and the LEDs below related to the hardware?
I mean, the label should preferrably come from the board documentation,
or a label on the PCB next to the LED. Also they shouldn't represent
any particular use case, so you should remove the ":heart" suffix.

style: Subnodes should be separated with blank lines.

Otherwise the patch looks fine.

Best regards,
Tomasz
