Do you have anything in particular in mind? I would be glad to implement
it and send patches.

I'm not sure what part of my patches exactly is turning cache-l2x0.c
into a pile of crap. On the contrary, I believe that working around the
firmware brokenness on platform level, while keeping the core code
simple does the opposite.

However, I'll be happy to rework my series if you have some more
specific suggestions.

Your opinion is always appreciated, thanks.
