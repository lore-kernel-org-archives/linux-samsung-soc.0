If this is a platform driver, it rather does need to access the device,
precisely because it doesn't know what power state the device is in oth=
erwise.

Except that the driver is arguably buggy.

But is it physically suspended?

The runtime PM status of the device after ->probe is required to reflec=
t its
real state if runtime PM is enabled.  If that's not the case, it is a b=
ug.

Now, for platform drivers, the driver can't really assume anything in
particular about the current power state of the device at ->probe time,
because different platforms including devices handled by that driver ma=
y
behave differently.

A good example would be two platforms A and B where the same device X i=
s in a
power domain such that A boots with the domain (physically) "on", while=
 B boots
with the domain "off".  If the driver for X assumes anything about the =
initial
power state of the device, it may not work on either A or B.

Which sounds OK to me, so why is it a problem?

Adding more callbacks to struct dev_pm_domain just in order to handle s=
ome
genpd-specific use case is out of the question.  If you find a way with=
in
genpd to address this the way you like, I'm open for ideas.  Otherwise,
let's just do what I said.

Well, I don't think so.

=46irst of all, there is a (very) limited number of platforms using gen=
pd today
and it should be perfectly possible to go through the platform drivers =
used
by them and see which of those drivers are affected.  Fixing them shoul=
d not
be too hard either.
