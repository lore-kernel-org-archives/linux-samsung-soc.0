Same for me. I don't have such a strong opinion about this so if you think that
I should re-spin to change to =m, I will.

I do think that we should try to keep the delta between exynos_defconfig and
multi_v7_defconfig as small as possible and eventually even get rid of
exynos_defconfig. Since building everything as built-in and having a config
targeted to a single platform is not aligned with the effort to have support for
multi platforms kernels.
