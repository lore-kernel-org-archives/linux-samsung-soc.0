I agree to remove 'drviers/devfreq/exynos/exynos_ppmu.c.
But, existing exynos_ppmu.c was used for drivers/devfreq/exynos/exynos5_bus.c.

Before removing existing 'exynos_ppmu.c', might need to test the devfreq-event class
on Exynos5260 SoC. I will just remove old driver('drivers/devfreq/exynos/exynos4_bus.{c|h}')
on next patchset.

To Abhilash,
Could you test this patch-set on Exynos5260 SoC?

Best Regards,
