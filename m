That is not how it works. Assuming that there was this "mythical
compatibility" then you would have to wait a few moments between marking
something "to be broken" and actually breaking it. In other words, if
you wanted to silence the "breaking compatibility" folks, then the patch
above should have been sent a while ago.

I saw the explanation for this order and I don't have problems with it.
However you can always split to separate patch the documentation for
bindings. It won't break bisectability.
