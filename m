I always thought that it is good to prepare patches in such a way that they
don't break runtime bisectability, especially if this is just a matter of
applying a few patches via the other tree. In this case it will work fine
if MFD patches gets applied with Lee Jones ack via pinctrl tree (I remember
that MFD changes were often applied via the other trees in the past).

I've just explained my rationale about the regmap lookup in the separate
mail.
