True, but unaligned stacks seem to be very rare, and I don't remember
ever seeing one with frame pointers enabled.  I think the call return
addresses will always be aligned, so I think it makes sense to align the
starting address before dumping.

Agreed.

Yeah, that would be an improvement.

Also a good idea.

Yeah, maybe.  I guess it really depends on what exactly the root cause
is.  It got a bad frame pointer somehow, but maybe not *too* bad because
it still ended up in the task stack somehow.  It's not clear how that
happened, but it's possible the task stack had some clues about what led
up to it.

I'll implement your suggestions in addition to the patch to align sp in
the dump code.  Having all of them together would hopefully enable the
unwinder to detect a bad condition as early as possible and also do a
better job at dumping it.
