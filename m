Ok, I will add them. I will try to find time to perform more precise
measurements.

I honestly don't know, don't have access to ARMv8 Exynos SoCs.
If i remember correctly there are no public-available 64-bit Exynos
boards yet. Exynos7420 is on the way to be released.

The main concern is that MCT probably not enabled for arm64 and
some cleanup/re-factoring is required for cycles_t variable. See
message in exynos4_read_current_timer() in MCT.
Also ARMv8 requires arm generic timer to be available and fully
operational. So for me it looks like current upstream kernel will work
on top of arm arch timer.

Yeah. Will fix it right away.

Agree.

Thanks for comments and review.
