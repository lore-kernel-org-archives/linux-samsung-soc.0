This is really silly.  Let's say that the program which results in
this function called is using signals (eg, alarm() with SIGALRM, or
asynchronous IO with SIGIO, etc).

Why should having a SIGALRM raised print a kernel message?  If this
happens a lot, it will result in the kernel log being flooded with
these messages.

Signals should not be seen as exceptional conditions.  For some programs,
they are merely asynchronous events which are a normal part of the
programs operation (eg, SIGIO, SIGALRM, etc.)

Please, if you are going to handle signals, then handle them properly.
If you're not going to handle them properly, don't use a wait that
caters for them - use wait_for_completion_killable_timeout() which
doesn't finish waiting on a signal unless the signal is going to result
in the death of the program.
