Okay, so maybe "discoverable buses" isn't the proper term.

Yes. But my point is that the struct device may be created dynamically
at some point in time.

This is how mmc/sd/sdio cards are handled. We don't have the
information about the card and thus not the struct device of it, until
we have detected it. Maybe we could at that point try to add the
device to its PM domain?

Currently, dev_pm_domain_attach() is being invoked at the point when a
SDIO card has been found. From sdio_add_func(). How would that be
solved?

Kind regards
