This patchset removes all uses of 'clk_type' member from the platform data
of sdhci-s3c driver and adds device tree support for sdhci-s3c driver. This
patchset has merged the following two patchsets submitted earlier into one
patchset.

[PATCH 0/3] mmc: sdhci-s3c: Remove 'clk_type' member from platform data
[PATCH 0/3] mmc: sdhci-s3c: Add device tree support for Samsung's sdhci controller driver

This patchset is rebased over the patches for sdhci clock lookup using
generic names.

In this patchset, all uses of 'clk_type' member from the platform data are
removed from the sdhci-s3c driver and platform code. The clk_type is a SoC
specific information and not a board/machine specific information. Hence, this
information can be more aptly represented using SoC specific driver data in the
sdhci-s3c driver.

Hence all uses of 'clk_type' member in sdhci-s3c driver's platform data is
removed. In place of that, the sdhci host qurik 'SDHCI_QUIRK_NONSTANDARD_CLOCK'
is used to handle controllers that do not have a standard sdclk division
(like those in the exynos4 SoC's).

This is a pre-requisite for adding device tree support for sdhci-s3c driver.
While migrating towards device tree support, retreving 'clk_type' information
from device tree information does not seem correct and hence it has been added
as SoC specific driver data. All this is handled in patches 1 to 3.

Patch 4 to 6 add device tree support for sdhci-s3c driver. The fourth patch
modifies the sdhci-s3c driver to mainatain a local copy of the platform data,
which makes it easier to add device tree support for the driver.

Fifth patch adds support for parsing of mmc host controller capabilities from a
device node. This code would be reusable across other platforms as well. The
last patch adds device tree based discovery for the sdhci-s3c driver.

In this patchset, the comments from Rob Herring for the fifth patch in this
series has been addressed.

This patchset is based on the following tree.
