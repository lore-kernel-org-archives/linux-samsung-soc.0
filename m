An IOMMU is really a specialised bridge, so it may be cleaner to describe
an IOMMU using a real bus node in the DT, if we also define a way to make
master/slave linkages explicit where it matters.


The problems of how to describe master/slave linkage, coherency between
masters, and how to describe sideband ID information present on the bus
are really interrelated.


If we can come up with a consistent description for these things, it
should help us to describe IOMMUs, bus mastering peripherals, MSI
controllers and complex bridges in a more uniform way, without having to
reinvent so much for each binding.  That's my hope anyway.

I've been hacking around some proposals on these areas which are a bit
different from the approach suggested here -- I'll try to summarise some
of it intelligibly and post something tomorrow so that we can discuss.

You mean "a device that contains multiple independent bus masters",
right?  In particular, a device composed of multiple bus masters that
do different things or should be handled differently by the interconnect.

There has definitely been talk on the list about real devices that
use multiple stream IDs.


I'll ask around for "device-like" examples, but the most obvious
example is the IOMMU itself.

Transactions generated by the IOMMU clearly need to be handled
differently by the interconnect, compared with transactions
translated and forwarded by IOMMU on behalf of its clients.

For example, suppose devices can post MSIs to an interrupt controller
via a mailbox accessed through the IOMMU.  Suppose also that the IOMMU
generates MSIs itself in order to signal management events or faults
to a host OS.  Linux (as host) will need to configure the interrupt
controller separately for the IOMMU and for the IOMMU clients.  This
means that Linux needs to know which IDs may travel to the interrupt
controller for which purpose, and they must be distinct.

I'm not sure whether there is actually a SoC today that is MSI-capable
and contains an IOMMU, but all the components to build one are out
there today.  GICv3 is also explicitly designed to support such
systems.


In the future, it is likely that "HSA"-style GPUs and other high-
throughput virtualisable bus mastering devices will have capabilities
of this sort, but I don't think there's anything concrete yet.

Ideally, we would reuse the ePAPR "ranges" concept and describe the way
sideband ID signals propagate down the bus hierarchy in a similar way.
