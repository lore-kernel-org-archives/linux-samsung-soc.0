That's right. I believe this should match what I wrote in my mail.

Right. Although all the levels above don't take into account state of
the inverter. What's shown on the diagram in the datasheet is with
inverter disabled, which corresponds to Linux's PWM_POLARITY_INVERSED.

This is strange. I remember verifying various edge cases with a scope on
an Exynos4210-based Origen board and I don't recall any issues.
Unfortunately I don't have appropriate hardware to recheck this specific
case anymore.

Could you specify on what board you are testing this or how the LED is
wired?

Most likely because u-boot doesn't switch the pinmux from default input
to respective special function.

The diagram illustrates how the hardware works. It shows TOUT levels
without inverter enabled. Still, the inverter simply negates the signal,
so the diagram is applicable, just with the exception that you need to
consider the output inverted.
