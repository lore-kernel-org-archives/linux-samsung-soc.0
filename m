Ok, since you just said on irc that the corrupted frame is some random
color, that's indeed not cool. What all other drivers (well at least
i915) do is:

1. Enable the screen, but scan out nothing as a pure black. This might
mean you need to set up the blend unit with a background color of
black.
2. Do an atomic flip to the new screen contents.

This way you get the sequence implement in the new _rpm
implementation. And for most normal hw this gives you the simplest
implementation, and has the benefit that writing to disabled hw blocks
indicates a bug. Wrapping an entire sequence with rpm_get/put like
Laurent describes is a really good way to hide bugs (e.g. write new
stuff to hw you're about to disable and then drop the hw settings on
the floor). Yes it makes implementation a bit easier, but easier !=
more correct in many cases. Nasty self-checks are good for getting kms
implementation rights.

Another benefit of this sequence is that the initial plane enable
after a crtc enable is like any other "background black -> planes"
atomic switch, and atomic does allow you to disable all planes. So
your driver better supports that (or is one of the few which has to
reject a config without any planes), since userspace might want to
enable the CRTC with no planes, and then you have the exact same bug
again.

It sounds like Laurent's 3rd gen rcar-du is special, and so needs
special code (or well just a bugfix to enable the composer with all
black in the CRTC enable code.

Cheers, Daniel
