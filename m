Ok, I agree with Rob. I was mixing pin muxing here. So if we have
'cd-gpios' and 'broken-cd' as generic bindings, would the following be
valid?

[A] cd-gpios not present ,  broken-cd not present : This means that
there is no card detect pin available. Controller drivers are free to
infer this as "card detection is broken" and use implementation
specific behavior.

[B] cd-gpio not present , broken-cd present :  This means that there
is nothing connected to the card-detect pad of the mmc host
controller. Controller drivers are free to use implementation specific
behavior to deal with card detection.

[C] cd-gpio present, broken-cd not present : This means that 'cd-gpio'
line connects card-detect pad of the controller to the card-detect pin
of the mmc slot.

[D] cd-gpio present, broken-cd present : This means that there is
nothing connected to the card-detect pad of the mmc host controller.
Controller drivers are free to use the 'cd-gpio' line in any
implementation specific way.

Thanks,
Thomas.
