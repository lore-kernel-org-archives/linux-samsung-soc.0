I don't find it horrible either, it's not too much code. The question was more 
about which version(s) to consider standard enough to provide a core helper 
for.

What bothers me a bit more with the copy&paste implementations isn't so much 
the commit tail handling itself, but the consequences it has on the rest of 
the driver. Drivers pick the order they want based on their requirements, and 
that order then leads to different race conditions between the drivers. We 
don't document the potential issues there, so new drivers (and for that 
matter, possibly existing ones) will likely have bugs if the author is not 
aware of the subtle issues related to the particular operation order they 
happen to use.

Maybe that should be all of them instead of most of them ?
