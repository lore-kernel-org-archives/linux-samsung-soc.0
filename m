Nothing come easy to me, I had to do bit of work on this.
Internally I might not know the detail of the board and features of
the registers of the PMIC.
I have to improvise some time for changes. I don't know who is the
original author of the code.

It's relay hard to convince you on the changes, as I continue to
repeat the mistake.
I will try to improve my commits a be specific to the changes in the future.
