Hello,

Based on the preinstalled 3.8 based ChromeOS kernel and previous 3.15=20
based attempts by Stephan and me that broke for 3.16, I've prepared a=20
device tree for the HP Chromebook 11 aka Google Spring.

v3 mainly does style cleanups, aligning Snow and Spring better.

Not yet enabled are trackpad, Wifi and sound.

My rebasing branch for testing is here:
https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commits/spring-next

Regards,
Andreas

v1 -> v2:
* Dropped 3 documentation patches from series:
  2 picked up,
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4397271/
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4397291/
  1 already sent separately as v2, pending.
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4424881/
* Minimized and beautified Spring device tree and to some degree Snow a=
s well.
  See individual patches.

v2 -> v3:
* Rebased: Two -cros-common cleanup patches were already applied
* Lots of small cleanups for both Snow and Spring
* Enabled I2S in Spring for symmetry
* Added lid-switch and gpio-keys pinctrls to Spring
