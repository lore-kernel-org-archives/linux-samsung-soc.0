Ok, I only saw that a call to mask_irq was made in suspend_device_irq [0]
if IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND was set but I didn't see the inverse operation
in the resume path. But now looking at irq_enable() I see that the IRQ is
unmasked if it was disabled so that's why is not needed.

Well both interrupts that are a wakeup source and those that are not,
don't work after a resume. IOW, all the interrupts whose source is the
combiner are not working.

Good question, I didn't find in the documentation I've access to that
this happen but just found through experimentation that the IRQ enable
set register values are lost after a resume and that saving/restoring
the values makes the interrupts to be triggered again.

Yes, I agree that is good to have a irq_set_wake callback, what is still
not clear to me is if is needed to solve this particular issue or not.
