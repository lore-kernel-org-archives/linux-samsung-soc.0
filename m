C-A15 doesn't have any SCU registers exposed (and it's enabled by
default).

The SCU is part of the core TRM, so I don't expect it to be the same
across various MP cores (and A15 is an example).

You may want to consolidate functions like scu_prepare_cpus (maybe call
it smp_prepare_cpus) and something that calls set_cpu_possible() but
with platform callbacks for getting the number of calls and initialising
the SMP (SCU for most platforms).

Whether this is worth, I don't know.
