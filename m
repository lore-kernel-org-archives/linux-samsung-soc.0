there is code replacement ofcourse ->
* the logic of walking down the list holding a mutex has been replaced
with rcu locks,
* instead of reading internal data structure and generating the list,
use the existing search API that does exactly the same.
* Documentation update for the same.

Both are needed if you have to move the code out. functionally, both
are equivalent

Alrite. will do, I try to trim the headers down to bare minimum, but
will take care of it in the formal post.

There are none at the moment. ideally, we'd like to discourage folks
putting cpufreq drivers in arch/ given the amount of effort you have
undertaken in bringing them all here. but I have personally no strong
objection to getting rid of the private header and using the generic
cpufreq header.

Otherwise, I assume you are ok with this approach and will post a
formal patch by monday.
