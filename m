Great, thanks.

Great, thanks for clarifying.

I've now tested your v2 branch with the bL switcher disabled, CPUidle
enabled and CPUfreq enabled.  

With the default governor set to performance, it fails to boot.  The last
kernel messages on the console are:

[...]
[    3.426021] cpu cpu0: bL_cpufreq_init: CPU 0 initialized
[    3.431189] cpu cpu4: bL_cpufreq_init: CPU 4 initialized

However, with the default governor set to userspace it boots fine until
my userspace (ubuntu) tries to enable the ondemand governor, and then it
hangs. 

For it to boot, I have to disable the ondemand governor, and set the
default governor to userspace.

As I reported earlier on Thomas' series, I suspect this is related to
the fact that the higher OPPs aren't really functional without voltage
scaling also supported. 

I'm also seeing the wait_until_divider_stable errors when switching
between the available A7 OPPs.  I'd reported this one earlier as well,
along with the script to reproduce it.
