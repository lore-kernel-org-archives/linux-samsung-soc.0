Yes exactly what I mentioned couple of times on previous version of this
patch set[1][2]

I was told that index is not preferred based on the previous discussions
when the OPP bindings were designed. In addition the OPP binding doesn't
enforce any ordering. There are thermal bindings that assume otherwise and
is broken. So boost-points is not feasible.

IMO, at-least the existing OPP binding can't distinguish between under-,
nominal- and over-drive OPP points. So my suggestion was to have a property
that provides the beginning of these 3 points on the OPP curve.
