In case of idle state you're right that clkgate would be better. But
what about finding a compromise between high performance (high
frequency) and energy saving for different loads on MMC?

The frequency scaling could help in that case. Anyway I should prepare
some more benchmarks for such conditions.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
