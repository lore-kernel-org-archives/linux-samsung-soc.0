What we can do, though, is to publicly shame you all Google People very 
strongly for not making firmware updates in the field safer and easier.  
After all you must all know already that, by definition, software always 
contains bugs.  The first feature to be tested with a new 
bootloader/firmware must be the ability to successfully and safely (and 
securely) update itself.  Especially for a mainstream device like a 
Chromebook.

So ... let's find the lesser of all evils ... as always.

Care to resume the proposed solution then?
