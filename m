It will be needed for CPUIDLE I guess.

That's typo. It should have been mcr. Actually VBAR isn't used on GP
devices but might be used on secure devices. I know that common suspend
code doesn't consider this register. It's fine to keep it that way
and if OMAP needs it, it can save/restored outside common code.
