Rubbish.  Please look at the commit you're quoting, it doesn't have
much to do with what I'm saying, and I think you're mis-remembering
on two counts.

The discussion came up recently (last November) about making
platform_get_irq() return an error rather than zero - in other words,
it will never return zero.  This is entirely different from making
platform_get_irq() return -ENXIO when an error occurs (not finding
the resource.)  This discussion was sparked by patch sets from
Arvind Yadav.

Further information can be found by looking up the discussions
around killing "NO_IRQ", particularly messages from Linus.

Secondly, the code today does:

int platform_get_irq(struct platform_device *dev, unsigned int num)
{
...
        return r ? r->start : -ENXIO;
}

So if the IRQ resource is not found, then yes, it will return -ENXIO.
If on the other hand the resource is found, then it will return
whatever is found in r->start, which can be zero.

As stated, IRQ 0 shall not be taken by drivers to be a valid
interrupt.
