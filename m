The your commented method is possible.

But, I focus on implementing the generic bus frequency driver.

If specific bus device-tree node includes the one more clocks,
when adding the new Exynos SoC, the exynos-bus.c should be added
for new Exynos SoC. Because, each Exynos SoC has the different
set of bus device.

If we use my approach, we don't need to modify the exynos-bus.c
driver to support for the bus frequency of new Exynos SoC.
