After looking a bit more through the code, I don't think the problem is=
 2416-
specific but seems to be caused by the gpio card-detect code.

sdhci_s3c_gpio_card_detect_thread calls sdhci_s3c_notify_change which i=
n turn=20
runs host->card_tasklet that seems to want to read stuff from the card.=
 But=20
this path seems to be missing a runtime-pm wakeup.

I'm not yet sure what to add, especially, as tasklet_finish (called on =
some=20
occasions from tasklet_card) already has a runtime_pm_put call, which w=
ould be=20
unpaired in this code path.

As there also could be other Samsung platforms affected that use the ex=
t-gpio=20
code, it's probably right to revert it for now. Or you see a easy fix :=
-) .
