This doesn't seem crazy, though it means that if you're planning on
using nothing but simplefb then you're never going to be able to get
any power savings anywhere.

Right now I know that clock disabling is supposed to be inhibited
during the early boot process.  I think regulators too?

In IRC I made a suggestion that perhaps the "simplefb" ought to be put
in the main in-kernel "dts" file but with no address information and
set to "disabled".  Then the firmware can do something very simple:
set to enabled and fill in the address.

Right now the firmware is taking a dts that it doesn't really own (it
grabs it from the kernel FIT image) and making changes to it to add
simplefb.  That's inherently pretty fragile.  If the kernel DTS file
adds regulators then as we saw things break.  I can imagine lots of
other breakages, too.  If the dts is in kernel then we can add
regulator / clock references very easily.  As regulators are added to
the kernel dts file then the references can be added to simplefb.

That doesn't solve the problem with people who have old copies of
U-Boot.  All of those people have already flashed a custom firmware
though, so it doesn't seem unreasonable (to me) to solve their problem
by giving them a new custom firmware.  I agree that something needs to
be done to help those people, but I don't feel like adding extra hacks
to the kernel is the right answer to solve people who are clearly
living on the bleeding edge.


Note that I haven't actually worked with simplefb or the custom
U-Boots, so perhaps there's something I'm missing...
