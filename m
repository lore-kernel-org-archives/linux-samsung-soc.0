Hello,

while looking through the patchset I noticed the following. In patch
07/16 code is added to drivers/cpufreq/exynos-cpufreq.c, which reminded
me of the cpufreq patchset by Thomas Abraham. If I remember correctly
then the ultimate goal of the cpufreq 'conversion' is to get rid of the
exynos-cpufreq driver is use the cpufreq-cpu0 (now cpufreq-dt) driver
for everything.

Now, this cpufreq patchset hasn't been updated in a while, so I'm not
sure if maybe plans have changed already. But if the goal still is to
remove exynos-cpufreq in the end, wouldn't it be better to not add new
(functionality-providing) code to it, like this series does?

With best wishes,
Tobias
