I have tested this patch series on SMDK5420 with cpuidle (with and
without b.L switcher enabled).

As of now voltage scaling support is not there in generic big-little
cpufreq driver (arm_big_little.c).
Hence need to tie arm and kfc voltages to highest level for testing.

Without this change stability issues are there, but with this change
everything is stable.
