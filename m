I wouldn't call it no design. It's a simple (trivial) design.

Simple design is often better than a complex one. In this case it indeed 
is, because it doesn't add code that serves no purpose, without any 
functional drawbacks.

Well, even if that happens, there is nothing on the way stopping from 
extending this design with something that will work optimally for multiple 
instances. For all currently supported platforms solution used in this 
series is enough.

Output mask is _not_ a part of the constant variant data. It is stored in 
the same struct, which is to simplify passing SoC-specific parameters from 
platform code to both drivers, but it is not defined as a constant 
anywhere in drivers.

As I already explained in one of my previous replies, it is either parsed 
from DT (samsung,pwm-outputs property) or passed through the variant 
struct as platform_data from board files. It isn't possible for both 
drivers to get different mask values.

What about:

/*
 * PWM block is shared between pwm-samsung and samsung_pwm_timer drivers
 * and some registers need access synchronization. If both drivers are
 * compiled in, the spinlock is defined in the clocksource driver,
 * otherwise following definition is used.
 *
 * Currently we do not need any more complex synchronization method 
 * because all the supported SoCs contain only one instance of the PWM 
 * IP. Should this change, both drivers will need to be modified to
 * properly synchronize accesses to particular instances.
 */

Best regards,
Tomasz
