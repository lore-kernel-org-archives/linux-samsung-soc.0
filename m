Marc may be better placed than me to comment on this in detail.

However, I believe it's correct to say that because the GIC is not part
of PCI, end-to-end MSI delivery inherently involves a non-PCI step from
the PCI RC to the GIC itself.

Thus this is likely to be a fundamental requirement for MSIs on ARM SoCs
using GIC, if we want to have a hope of mapping MSIs to VMs efficiently.

We can call it what we like and maybe bury the distinction in irqchip
drivers for some fixed-configuration cases, but it's logically the same
concept.  Naming and subsystem factoring are implementation decisions
for Linux.

For full dynamic assignment of pluggable devices or buses to VMs, I'm
less sure that we can model that as plain irqchips.

This is a fair point, but there is a difference between the bindings and
what kind of wacky configurations a particular version of Linux actually
supports.

DT is supposed to be a description of the hardware, not a description
of how Linux subsystems are structured, though if the two are not
reasonably well aligned that will lead to pain...

The key thing is to make sure the DT bindings are extensible to
things that we can reasonably foresee.

My concern here is that as new exceptions and oddball or complex systems
crop up, we will end up repeatedly inventing different bodges to solve
essentially the same problem.

Unlike some of the other situations we have to deal with, these are valid
hardware configurations rather than quirks or broken systems.


A more uniform approach is not necessarily a win, but it is worth discussing.
That will be easier with a bit more concrete detail -- I'll follow up with
something that I hope will focus the discussion a bit on this point.
