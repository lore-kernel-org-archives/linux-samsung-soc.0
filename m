I can't say I like to mark the regulators as always-on on the DT and that's
why I copied the patch in the response instead of posting it as a proper patch
but I think relying in the bootloaders to modify the DT is not better.

IMHO U-boot should only modify the strictly necessary like the /chosen branch
even though lately I've seen some attempts in the OMAP community to (ab)use
U-Boot's fdt command to mangle the DT before passing to the kernel in order to
support different Beagle Bone Black capes.

Best regards,
Javier
