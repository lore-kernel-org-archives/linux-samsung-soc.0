We have 22 Exynos-based boards currently supported in mainline. Is the
testing running on all of them? This is the purpose of linux-next and
for series that completely replace one driver with another I'd consider
this as the only reasonable choice, if not keeping the old driver for a
release.

Of course we have never had good testing traditions on Samsung SoC (see
OMAP and Tegra baseline tests), but does it mean that we shouldn't start
doing the right thing?

Best regards,
