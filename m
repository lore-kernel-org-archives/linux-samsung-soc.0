Yes.

This thing about regulator being boot-on should really be documented.

Moreover, I think it's a waste of power to keep the devices ON on boot even if 
the PCIe bus was not started (yet). The bus might not be started at all and the 
regulators would still be ON, which would be quite a waste.

The power should be controlled per-slot, but I don't know how to model that. 
Note that there might be a PCIe device with a switch popped into a single slot, 
which makes things much more interesting. In such case, you need to power up the 
slot and neither of the downstream devices should control the power regulator of 
that slot.

OK, I was blind, sorry.
