Nope, it has nothing to device tree nor ACPI. The dependency is a direct
result of the way the devices operate.

The main feature of device links that is used in this patch is enabling
runtime pm dependency between Exynos SYSMMU controller (called it client
device) and the device, for which it implements DMA address translation
(called master device). The assumptions are following:
1. master device driver is completely unaware of the Exynos SYSMMU presence,
    IOMMU is transparently hooked up and managed by DMA-mapping framework
2. SYSMMU belongs to the same power domain as it's master device
3. SYSMMU is optional, master device can fully operate without it, with
    simple DMA address translation (DMA address == physical address)
4. Master device implements runtime pm, what in turn causes respective
    power domain to be turned on/off
5. DMA-mapping and IOMMU frameworks provides no calls to notify SYSMMU
    when its master device is performing DMA operations, so SYSMMU has
    to be runtime active
6. Currently SYSMMU always sets its runtime pm status to active after
    attaching to its master device to ensure proper hardware state. This
    prevents power domain to be turned off, even when master device sets
    its runtime pm status to suspended.
7. Exynos SYSMMU has to be runtime active at the same time when its
    master device is runtime active to it to perform DMA operations and
    allow the power domain to be turned off, when master device is
    runtime suspended.
8. The terms of device links, Exynos SYSMMU is a 'consumer' and master
    device is a 'supplier'.

Nope, none of that solution deals with runtime pm.
