Dear all,

> please regard it solely as a pure RFC.
> 
> This patch provides support for LAB governor build on top of ondemand.
> Previous version of LAB can be found here:
> http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1484746/match=cpufreq
> 
> LAB short reminder:
> 
> LAB uses information about how many cores are in "idle" state (the
> core idleness is represented as the value between 0 and 100) and the
> overall load of the system (from 0 to 100) to decide about frequency
> to be set. It is extremely useful with SoCs like Exynos4412, which
> can set only one frequency for all cores.
> 
> Important design decisions:
> 
> - Reuse well established ondemand governor's internal code. To do this
>   I had to expose some previously static internal ondemand code. 
>   This allowed smaller LAB code when compared to previous version.
> 	
> - LAB works on top of ondemand, which means that one via device tree
>   attributes can specify if and when e.g. BOOST shall be enabled or
> if any particular frequency shall be imposed. For situation NOT
> important from the power consumption reduction viewpoint the ondemand
> is used to set proper frequency.
> 
> - It is only possible to either compile in or not the LAB into the
> kernel. There is no "M" option for Kconfig. It is done on purpose,
> since ondemand itself can be also compiled as a module and then it
> would be possible to remove ondemand when LAB is working on top of it.
> 
> - The LAB operation is specified (and thereof extendable) via device
> tree lab-ctrl-freq attribute defined at /cpus/cpu0.
> 
> 
> Problems:
> - How the governor will work for big.LITTLE systems (especially
> Global Task Scheduling).
> - Will there be agreement to expose internal ondemand code to be
> reused for more specialized governors.
> 
> Test HW:
> 	Exynos4412 - Trats2 board.

Any comments about those patches?
