Looks like the hub GetPortStatus request fails with protocol error.

Reading xhci root hub port status is mostly just register reads and writes. It
shouldn't include any actual transfers that could return -EPROTO

So this is not the root hub? but a external or integrated on your board, right?

The protocol error -71 is returned at transfer errors or if device stalled.

Adding more xhci debugging options could show something:
echo -n 'module xhci_hcd =p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

The additional patches that makes things somehow work involve tuning the PHY,
this is an area I'm not familiar with
