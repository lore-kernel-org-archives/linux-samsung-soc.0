Yeah, we spent a whole lot of time on this too before giving up after
we found out it was not possible to use.

Maybe not a bad idea.  Depends if you think someone else will try to
do this...  ...and if they do, will they check mailing list traffic.

Well, it looked like it worked for us too.  In fact, I never saw a
failure.  All I know is that Samsung said: don't do this, it's not a
good idea.  The performance gain wasn't enough to go against that...
That's when I started trying to optimize the MCT a little bit.  ;)
