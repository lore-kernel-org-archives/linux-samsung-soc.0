Agreed, let's see what Rafael says about it.

I see, but still I feel as if it may be a lot of duplication since most
platforms will likely want to call the regulator core suspend prepare
and finish functions. Maybe it can be added as a Kconfig option so each
platform can choose at the config level if they want those to be called?
