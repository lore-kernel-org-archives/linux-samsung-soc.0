I think we need to get rid of the SoC specific code already.  For
example, we're already seeing SoCs where the arm32 core is being
replaced by an arm64 core but the other IPs, and power-domain logic is
staying more or less the same.

Or more likely, probably some compatible string, or property in the
domain node.  Grygorii, Arnd and myself were discussing this elsewhere
in the context of the TI Keystone2 PM domain support[1].
