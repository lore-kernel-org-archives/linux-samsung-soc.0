I mentioned in the cover letter [0] that this series were based on top
of in-flight patches from Krzysztof Kozlowski to avoid merge conflicts.

Ok, my intention was to make picking both patch series easier but if
this is inconvenient to you, I can base on top of current mainline
and let you handle the merge conflicts (or ask Krzysztof to resend
on top of my patches).
