Well I was also not quite sure about if "drivers/mfd" is proper place
for Exynos PMU, so I posted this patch as RFC.

If it does not seems matching with "drivers/mfd" idea, will it be suitable
for "drivers/power/" or should I go for something like "drivers/soc/samsung"?

Regarding your second point about merging this code with "mach-exynos/pm.c"
We have plan for this but, I would like to get it done via a separate patch 
series
as "mach-exynos/pm.c" has a lot of dependencies and requires significant
modifications. So this work can be treated as a first step towards that 
direction.
