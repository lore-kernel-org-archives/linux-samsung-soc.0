Where did you get that number from?

Also please note that some bus types don't have this problem by design (e.g. PCI,
as pointed to by Alan).

It looks like you're confusing disable/enable with auto/on.  These are different
things.

The PM domain itself can't do that.  The only place that has enough knowledge
is the code that enumerates devices (DT, ACPI or board-specific).

This is how the "power/control" file works and you can easily have this by writing
"on" to that file for every device.

Use case?

That I can't parse really, sorry.
