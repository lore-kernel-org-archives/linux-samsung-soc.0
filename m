What, you mean you don't know the fundamental rules of kernel development?

No one should ever dump any new code into linux-next during a merge
window which is not a fix for a regression or a bug fix, period.

Linus has in the past taken a snapshot of linux-next at the beginning
of a merge window, and then threatened to refuse to merge anything that
wasn't in his local snapshot, or which doesn't qualify as the above.

So no, it won't be possible, because I play by the community rules when
it comes to what gets merged and at what time in the cycle.
