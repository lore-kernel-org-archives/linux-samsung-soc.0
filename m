Thanks for the suggestion and apologies for the late response. Last couple of 
days I've been figuring out what this would involve and I decided that I want
to give this a try. I found this patch series [1] that I'll use as an example.
If I understand it correctly, I'll need to create a dma_slave_map and
pass that via the platform data into the s3c24xx-dma driver. There I'll
need to fill in the filter_map of the dma slave device. Right?
