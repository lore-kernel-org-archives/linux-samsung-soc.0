For cross SoC drivers this statement is not correct! Driver _must_
support the various combinations of CONFIG_PM*.

Therefore, I think it's better to strive towards a common solution and
to get the building blocks in place.

I can't see why the sysfs option to disable runtime PM should affect
this discussion. That's done at runtime and after the device has been
probed.

That's right. But that's not what this patchset aims to do.

I realize that the header of the cover letter isn't describing the
problem I am trying to solve very well. I guess the below header would
have been better:

"PM / Domains: Power up PM domains prior drivers starts to probe their devices"

> - it can wake up power domain

Yes, but it requires CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to be set.

Thus, to solve the problem during driver ->probe() we need another
solution which don't require CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to be set. As this
patchset proposes.

I am not sure what you mean about dropping pm_runtime_get_sync()? All
I am saying is that we can't use it to power on PM domains during the
probe sequence.

Of course, you may still use pm_runtime_get_sync() from anywhere it's
needed, to for example handle device's parent/child relationships.

We don't have to change these drivers. An certainly they are not 500. :-)

They will still work as is!

Though we need this fix to comply with them, which is supposed to go
in for 3.18 rc[n].
