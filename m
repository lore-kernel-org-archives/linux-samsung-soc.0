Yes, this patch series is mainly moving files around. But to avoid git
bisect breakage, it should be split as it is done now, or the whole
series should be squashed into one patch. The latter might be even easier
to handle, but having a single patch touching arch/arm/ and drivers/
might not be a good idea. If you're fine handling that, then we just
need to squash this series into single patch.
It just need to be ensured, IMO, there is no bisection breakage.
