Kukjin,

The branch contents is not the same as your repeated pull request, it had
patches added on the 26th and the original request was sent on the 21st. I've
pulled it anyway after reviewing those patches, but please be more transparent
with what you do to your branch if you update it after pull requests have been
sent.

Also, next time please do a full re-send of the pull request, I probably missed
it because it was a reply with just a new link and not the full diffstat, etc.
