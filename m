We could do that for genpd if devices were added to domains before registering
(those devices).  Otherwise, there's no guarantee that all has been set up yet.

Note that this would only be the case for genpd, not for the ACPI PM domain
in particular, for example.  The reason why is that the ACPI PM domain cannot
be used along with bus types that provide non-trivial PM callbacks, so pretty
much the bus type's ->probe needs to decide whether or not to use it.

For genpd, yes.  Not necessarily for other types of PM domains.  [A "PM domain"
is just an override for bus type PM callbacks in general, genpd is only one
use case here.]

I think that the the general DT bindings for genpd are the source of the whole
complication here.  Before, devices were added to domains in the board-specific
code before registration, but now that can be done automatically if the
appropriate bindings are present in the DT.

It may not be the case for the platform bus type or other "root kind" bus
types where devices may not have a functional parent.  Otherwise it usually
is the case.

Anyway, that really depends on the bus type.
