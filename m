Would it make sense to enable EXYNOS_IOMMU in exynos_defconfig. I sent
a patch to do that a while back. The decision at the time to not pull
that patch is was based on systems not booting with it enabled.

Is it time to revisit that or the recommendation is for IOMMU to be
enabled in configs manually on systems it is safe to do so?
