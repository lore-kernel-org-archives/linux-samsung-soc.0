the current code would treat the signal case identical with the
completion success case - and that hardly can be the intention
so while it might not be necessary to call printk in the signal
case it should in some way be handled - if there is not need to 
handle signals then it might be more resonable to use
wait_for_completion_timeout which is not interruptible.

So the key issue here is not that a signal should necessarily print
a message but that it should not be treated as the success case. The
current code will only treat timeout as an error condition and a received
signal (implying that the condition being waited for is most likely not
satisfied) as a successful completion.
