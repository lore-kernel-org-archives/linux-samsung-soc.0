Hello Steve,
It works well as both host and guest on the model.

It is a better description compared to my logic.
I fully understand your intention now.
It would be good to adopt your code instead of mine.

How about participating as an author of this part if you are okay?

I am posting v4 patches as soon as possible and then
figuring out a way to take you as an author of this head.S.

It is better to write a patch by you, not me.
Then, I will review it.
