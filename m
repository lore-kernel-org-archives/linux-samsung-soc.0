Agreed, it's not easy but needs to be fixed :)

Not entirely true, it assuming the fact that the logical index provided 
by the OS is completely based on the ordering in the DT.

No, I disagree as you trying to implicitly depend on the logic Linux 
uses to assign logical index. It can be changed any time, and depending
on it might break things in future which can't be fixed easily later
especially if it's DT related.

How can you assume that ? I can write a simple test which hot-plugs out
all the CPUs in the (esp. multi-cluster) system in ascending order of
logical index and hot-plug back in descending order. Then the above
logic fails.

The platforms needing it have to get involved in such discussions to
make any progress.
