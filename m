Cc'ing Rafael again. Guys please don't miss him for any PM related
stuff or use get_maintainers ..

Cc'ing Arnd/Olof as well to discuss the merge stuff..

That is merged by Rafael Yesterday. That is manageable

So there is no build dependency with OPP patches I hope, as its all
about using the bindings defined by them. And so you don't need to
depend on that.

You might have to rebase on the ARM tree to manage your conflicts. In
this case you can rebase directly on ARM SoC branch which has your
patches (rebase directly over the last patch instead of the whole
branch) and make sure Olof knows about this and he doesn't update
(i.e. rebase) his branch, which he might not anyway.

The whole idea is to keep a single sha-id for a commit. So you can
rebase over the published material present in ARM-SoC ..
