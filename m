In this case, the binding would be applicable only to nVidia's SDHCI
controller. And this binding would select MMC_CAP_8_BIT_DATA in the
sdhci-tegra driver. There are sdhci drivers that can accept host
capabilities via platform data.

The MMC_CAP_XXX macros in linux/mmc/host.h file are usuable across
host controllers and some of them are supplied as platform data for
non-device tree platforms.

So, bindings for MMC_CAP_XXX macros can be defined which any host
controller supporting device tree could use. Host controllers could
use the mmc_of_parse_host_caps() helper function (listed in this
patch) to parse all the bindings for MMC_CAP_XXX  available in the
device node.

I would like to retain this patch in this series but if there is a
definite no, then I will drop it. Please let me know your opinion.

Thanks,
Thomas.
