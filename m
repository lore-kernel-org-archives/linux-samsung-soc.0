No, see my last comment in the previous email.  I think this freezes the
DMA in the following scenario:

pl330_submit_req()
pl330_chan_ctrl(PL33O_OP_START)
... wait for the transfer to finish ...
pl330_update()
...
pl330_submit_req()
pl330_submit_req()
pl330_chan_ctrl(PL330_OP_START)

The pl330 won't start because of the same reason, we have a request in
buffer 0 and _thrd_active() would say that it is active.  This can
happen if drivers/dma/pl330.c:fill_queues() introduces two requests
before calling pl330_chan_ctrl(), which I'm not entirely sure that it
can't happen.

I think the best solution would be to revert
ee3f615819404a9438b2dd01b7a39f276d2737f2 and go back to my original
patch (in the beginning of this thread):

What do you think?  Thanks,
Javi
