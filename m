Ok, sorry.

Ok, yes these were pulled from get_maintainer.

I'll make sure I do that next time.

The cover letter read:

Some Chromebooks have gpio attached to signals used to cause the 
firmware to enter alternative modes of operation and/or control other 
device characteristics (such as write protection on flash devices). This 
patch adds a driver that exposes a read-only interface to allow these 
signals to be read from user space.

In addition this patch series provides the required bindings for this to 
the peach-pi Chromebook.


This is a new binding, but the driver is based on functionality in the 
kernel shipped on Chromebooks. The binding has been modified based on 
the form of existing bindings in the mainline kernel.

Does that help?
