Oh, I didn't know about this. Sounds like a good idea. :)

Ah, right, I recall now, I even reviewed relevant patch. Thanks for
refreshing my memory.

I thought a clock from another CMU has to be enabled for the CPU to be
able to access the CMU being registered.

Yeah, maybe the explanation could be a bit more precise.
