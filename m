The LDO10 is supplying few more elements (MIPI, HDMI, ADC and
something called EFNAND). Having it non-always-on still works but
maybe because I did not test these elements.

LDO12 and LDO15 supply also VDD10_HSIC and UHOST (used by USB2.0 ports
and attached on board: usb3503 and lan9730) so if it is not enabled by
USB 3.0, then they won't work. I guess the usb 2.0 driver should also
take regulators.

So overall the board works after removing always-on but it is not
properly described in DT so I prefer to leave them.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
