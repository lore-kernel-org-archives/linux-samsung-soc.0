I tried to leave the ones that look like they've been around for a while
backwards compatible (gpio, esdhc), while changing the relatively new
ones without backwards compatibility code.

Maybe the GPIO maintainer can comment on this. My understanding is
that not all gpio controllers support this in their bindings. If they
do, I agree that we can remove the extra properties here.

Right, my mistake.

yes, good idea.

For now, I was trying to get the binding document right. I suppose as a follow-up,
we can actually add a common helper function to decode these attributes and set
the right flag in the mmc device, but that is not urgent. Right now, I mainly
want to make sure we gain no new users that have conflicting bindings.
