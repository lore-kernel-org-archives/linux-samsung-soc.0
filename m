During suspend, the device can already be in sleep state (CMD5) before 
mmc_power_off()
is called from mmc_suspend_host(). As per eMMC specification, when the 
device is in sleep state,
it can only respond to RESET commands (CMD0 with argument of either 
0x00000000 or
0xF0F0F0F0 or H/W reset) and awake command (CMD5).  So, how does this 
switch going
to happen (CMD6) if it is in sleep state?

Thanks,
Sahitya.
