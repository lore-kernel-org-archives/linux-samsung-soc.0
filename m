Unfortunately vendors can do crazy stuff if they want to. But we also
have an option to choose to enable it. Maybe the answer here is to say
no to MCT on 64-bit, they get to use the arch timers like everybody
else. Or at least motivate why they're not good enough.

I think you have a good point. Until we hear why MCT is needed this is
mostly speculation, so let's see what Kukjin says about that.
