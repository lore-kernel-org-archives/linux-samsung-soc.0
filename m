Yes. It looks that I was confused by the code, where the term 'slave'
appears a few times. 'Client' is a bit more appropriate then.

Okay, I came to such conclusion basing one the dma engine code, but maybe
I missed something. However in such case such callback will be called for
each client device and it will be up to the driver to handle that.

That's okay, the name of the callbacks should be changed.

I'm a new to the DMA engine framework, I'm sorry for using wrong terms.

DMA engine driver might need to do something with it (like setting up a pm
link for example) before starting any operations. It would be great if the
pointer to client device is available in device_alloc_chan_resources(), but
propagating it there is not possible without significant changes. That's why
I came with this a separate callback.

Maybe the client device shouldn't be stored in the dma_chan structure at all
and left to the drivers to use or manage it if really needed. This will also
solve the issue with virt-dma you have mentioned.

In the previous version I managed to pass client device pointer to
device_alloc_chan_resources() via of_xlate callback (please take a look into
v7), but that approach was rejected by Lars-Peter Clausen.
