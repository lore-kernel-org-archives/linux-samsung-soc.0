This one is already applied.

It's a complete binding change, so applying one part without the other
is going to horribly break things.

So I would at least want to see an ack for the binding change on the
i.MX side from Shawn and Richard. This will need some follow on patches,
as some boards adding PCIe using the old binding have cropped up in
linux-next, but I can do the patches on short notice if everyone agrees
to merge this patchset.

The designware part is pretty simple and doesn't change anything for
other users than i.MX. Though I would like to see an ack from Jingoo for
those.

I have some more stuff in the pipes regarding multiple MSI irqs, that
depend on this series and also the Keystone people are waiting for this
to be applied in order to consolidate the clock handling of the
designware core driver, so it would be nice to get this moving again.

Regards,
Lucas
