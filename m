Okay, I got your means. So document is not the focus, the most importan=
t=20
is that
driver should support the old dts prop. If so the new analogix dp drive=
r=20
should keep
the "samsung,color-space", rather then just mark it with [DEPRECATED] f=
lag.

But from your follow suggest, I think you agree to update driver code,=20
and just mark
old prop with deprecated flag. If so I think such code would not be wro=
ng

-       if (of_property_read_u32(dp_node, "samsung,color-space",
+      if (of_property_read_u32(dp_node, "analogix,color-space",

And actually @Rob have suggest me to remove the prefix, just use=20
"color-space" here.

Whoops, thanks for your remind, I prefer the "touchscreen" style.

Oh, thanks for your careful explain, so I guess your first comment is=20
talking about
the "bisectability" that if I only apply the 01 - 05 patches, kernel=20
could not bootup
normally, cause driver need "analogix,color-space" but DTB only have=20
"samsung,color-space".

Aha, thanks  :-D
