Ok. For linux, "keypad,key-code" would mean linux keycodes. The
property name 'keypad,key-code' was chosen since it can be reused on
non-linux platforms as well. I did have a look at
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-keys.txt while doing this,
but preferred using 'keypad,key-code' since it would be generic. Given
a choice, I would like to retain this.

Thanks for your review.
