So, after giving this some more thought (and getting my hands dirty in
some of this code), I think I'm going to change my mind on this. For
mobile platforms I think it might make sense to bring over the
toplevel platform Kconfig from arch/arm, to simplify dependencies
without tearing up the driver subtree with churn like this.

This, of course, only holds true for v8 mobile platforms. Samsung
isn't saying if GH7 is a server platform and not, and they don't have
to tell us. But I think we should consider only enabling and bringing
over the mobile ones (and ideally try to avoid even that, but it might
make sense to do some of them at least initially -- it does provide
some convenient ways to enable larger subsets of default drivers per
platform/vendor family).

I.e. I'd be OK with an
ARCH_EXYNOS/ARCH_TEGRA/ARCH_IMX/ARCH_<whatever>, but I don't think we
should add more finegrained options than that globally on ARM64, at
least not until truly proven to be needed. We're trying to push back
against new per-SoC Kconfig entries on 32-bit as well right now.
