Ok. thanks for the update.

We should test with Ajay's patches which includes DP probe deferring
based on availability of bridge chip. +

few patches which cleanup register access in FIMD and DP probe/bind
OR
few patches to enable Display power domain and clocks just before the
register access. As done in https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/4/188.

Later solution results into display power domain enable failure in case of DRM
probe defer.

I am just curious if Andrej has some solution for the first approach which can
be tested for defer probe and S2R scenarios.

Rahul Sharma.
