No, normally it does not include the name of the IP, that's my whole point.
Including the name of the IP is completely pointless because that is
implied by the fact that it's being used by that particular IP.

Ideally you would find the data sheet for the ADC IP block and figure
out what this clock is used for, then find the right name for that.
In a lot of cases, we are actually better off not naming the clocks
at all but simply enumerating them if nobody knows what they are good
for. In that case, you would simply have the first clock and the second
clock of the ADC part and enable them both.
