ok.

So the idea is that you want to give the guest unfiltered access to the
PCI config space of an assigned device?

Is that safe?

If the config space access goes through the hypervisor (as I think we
always do today), there should be no isse.

I don't mind it being there, but if we don't need it, we shouldn't
have to use that isolation feature and be able to just allow any
initiator to send an MSI.
