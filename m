Yes their is slight improvement with these changes
I will share my test result once I add few more changes to this drive.

Thank for your explanation on the clk internals.
I have read few detail on the initial mainline list.

CLK_GATE_TOP_SCLK_FSYS

SCLK_USBDRD301       Gating SUSPEND_CLK for USBDRD30_1
SCLK_USBDRD300       Gating SUSPEND_CLK for USBDRD30_0
SCLK_USBPHY300        Gating USB30_SCLK_100M for USBDRD30_PHY_0
                                            Gating USB20_PICO_CLKCORE
for PICO PHY
SCLK_USBPHY300        Gating USB30_SCLK_100M for USBDRD30_PHY_1

So we did not considered the SUSPEN_CLK for phy.

Below is the clk structure diagram for usb drd phy.

Here is how it shown in manual.

So how can we support SUSPEND_CLK ?
Do we need to keep this SUSPEND_CLK enable ?

As of now my dts change are wrong
How about below changes.

 &usbdrd_phy0 {
-       clocks = <&clock CLK_USBD300>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBPHY300>;
+       clocks = <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBD300>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBPHY300>;
        clock-names = "phy", "ref";
        samsung,pmu-syscon = <&pmu_system_controller>;
 };
@@ -1476,7 +1476,7 @@
 };

 &usbdrd_phy1 {
-       clocks = <&clock CLK_USBD301>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBPHY301>;
+       clocks = <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBD301>, <&clock CLK_SCLK_USBPHY301>;
        clock-names = "phy", "ref";
        samsung,pmu-syscon = <&pmu_system_controller>;
 };
