This is an unfortunate side-effect of the education process, having
looked ast te s5p6440 code that is already queued for merging and the
s5pv210 code that is currently in review, there are a number of header
files that are common, for example:

<mach/hardware.h> which is 18 lines long has three lines different:

linux@linux-laptop:~/bjd.git$ diff -u arch/arm/mach-s5pv210/include/mach/hardware.h  arch/arm/mach-s5p6440/include/mach/hardware.h

The same is with <mach/system.h> where for 26 lines and have the same
three differences due to copyright date and placemeent.

With the map files, it isn't so bad as each chip does have differences
in the phyiscal addresses of hte peripheral blocks (yay) and thus we
can easily abstract the same data into a platform include with a unique
name.

As long as we have a clear policy then it makes it easier, my main worry
is that I've spent quite a lot of time trying to ensure that things are
not being duplicated and then have to turn around and say 'but not here'
and then end up having to try and ensure that the whole process does not
end up failing.

As a last comment, is a header file such as <mach/entry-macro.S> allowed
to be simply a copyright statement followed by including a platform
include file, as so:

/*
 * arch/arm/mach-foo/include/mach/entry-macro.S
 *
 * Copyright 2010 FooCorp
 *
 * Licensed under GPLv25B
*/

#include <plat/entry-macro-common-foocorp.S>
