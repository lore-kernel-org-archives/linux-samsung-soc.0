Ick, no.  Why can't you just pass the pointer to the phy itself?  If you
had a "priv" pointer to search from, then you could have just passed the
original phy pointer in the first place, right?

The issue is that a string "name" is not going to scale at all, as it
requires hard-coded information that will change over time (as the
existing clock interface is already showing.)

Please just pass the real "phy" pointer around, that's what it is there
for.  Your "board binding" logic/code should be able to handle this, as
it somehow was going to do the same thing with a "name".

thanks,
