Just to be clear, you need some agreement from the maintainers of
those platforms before doing this. It doesn't appear there is
disagreement, but I don't see any explicit agreement either.

This seems to model the interrupts as chained, but at least for some
cases aren't these auxiliary controllers in parallel to the GIC? In
other words, do the they require configuration for interrupts to work
for the normal non-wakeup use? I'm not sure that the h/w is being
modeled any more accurately if that is the case. However, we don't
really have a way to describe an interrupt line is connected to 2
interrupt parents in DT, so I'm not sure what else you could do here.
