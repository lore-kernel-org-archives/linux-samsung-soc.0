So has this series been picked up anywhere?  I don't see it in your
samsung-clk tree, nor in Kukjin's for-next.

Also, I'm curious whether or how this is has been tested on big.LITTLE
SoCs.  

I'm trying it on the 5800/Chromebook2 and it's not terribly stable.  I'm
testing along with CPUidle, so there may be some untested interactions
there as it seems a bit more stable without CPUidle enabled.

I'd love to hear from anyone else that's testing CPUidle and CPUfreq
together big.LITTLE 5420/5800, with or without the switcher.

Also, the patch below[2] is needed for 5800.

FWIW, I have a temporary branch[1] based on the v3.17-rc branch of the
exynos-reference tree where I've added the DT patch needed for CPUidle,
this series (and it's dependencies) which is what I'm using for testing.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: Exynos: use generic cpufreq driver for Exynos5800

As a derivative of the 5420, the 5800 SoC should use the generic
big.LITTLE driver for Exynos5800 as well.
