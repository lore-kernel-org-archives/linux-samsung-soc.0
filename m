AFAICS the genpd API doesn't for an architecture to move the clocks' control
out from drivers, it can be decided on individual basis for each clock. 
With Chanwoo's patches at least exynos power domains and global clock gates 
for devices (S5P_CLKGATE_BLOCK) are handled through the common API.

Also, it's not quite clear to me, can't the pm_clk_* calls be used by the drivers
to control the clocks as they need ?

Last time I looked at the genpd API, an important drawback was that pm_clk_suspend/
pm_clk_resume couldn't be used in interrupt context. Now it seems the mutexes in
the core functions has been replaced with spinlocks and such limitation is gone.

I'm considering using pm_clk* calls to implement clock gating in a video codec
driver. If, for instance, frame period is 30 ms and processing in the device takes
only 10 ms, significant power savings could be achieved by turning the clocks off
for the 20 ms idle period.
