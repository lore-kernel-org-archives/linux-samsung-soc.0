For the clock tree, it still seems to me that this is better handled in
the SoC clock driver.  For example, when a power domain is about to be
gated, all the devices in that domain are runtime suspended, and
presumably all of their gate clocks are disabled.  Now, doesn't the
clock driver know the clock tree parent-child hierarchy and shouldn't it
be capable of saving the state of parent clocks (like mux clocks) etc?

Stated diffrently, it still seems to me like we're pushing functionality
in PM core notifiers that should be the responsibility of subsystem
drivers.

This is what I'm not understanding.

Why can't the power domain driver's power_on/power_off callback just
call the PMU APIs and/or the clk_enable/_disable calls it needs?
