This patch executes the devfreq_suspend() for all devfreq devices.
The devfreq_suspend() does the following:
	1. (mandatory) stop the polling of governor.
	2. (optional)  If devfreq device specifies the 'opp-suspend'
	property in DT, the devfreq changes the frequency by using
	the devfreq->suspend_freq.

If the user of devfreq device doesn't want to change the frequency
during the system shutdown, just don't add the 'opp-suspend' property
in DT. And the devfreq_suspend() will just stop the polling for governor.

Even if on battery-powered devices, I think it is not problem
to stop the polling of governor during the system shutdown.

In my case, I don't know what is dangerous.
Could you explain it more detailed.
