I've been running the proposed frequency/voltage combinations without any
stability problems on my XU4, XU3 and even XU3-lite ( I did not delete the
nodes on XU3-lite dts) with make -j8 kernel and ssvb-cpuburn.
The chips are poorly cooled, especially the XU4 and quickly step down.

If you point me to how to read these values out, I will publish them.
