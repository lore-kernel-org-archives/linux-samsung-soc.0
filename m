For completeness, please let me quote the changelog of commit
564b905ab10d (PM / Domains: Rename struct dev_power_domain to struct dev_pm_domain)
dealing with this particular thing:

    The naming convention used by commit 7538e3db6e015e890825fbd9f86599b
    (PM: Add support for device power domains), which introduced the
    struct dev_power_domain type for representing device power domains,
    evidently confuses some developers who tend to think that objects
    of this type must correspond to "power domains" as defined by
    hardware, which is not the case.  Namely, at the kernel level, a
    struct dev_power_domain object can represent arbitrary set of devices
    that are mutually dependent power management-wise and need not belong
    to one hardware power domain.  To avoid that confusion, rename struct
    dev_power_domain to struct dev_pm_domain and rename the related
    pointers in struct device and struct pm_clk_notifier_block from
    pwr_domain to pm_domain.

And that should be explicitly explained in the PM documentation which I'm going
to do.
