Kept meaning to get back to this thread. Have you resolved it?

Well that's half good news.

This is pretty confusing. I don't see how the patch could cause this to
happen.

yeah. Can you give the output of /proc/timer_list in addition to
/proc/interrupts? It may give some hints on what's going on. It may also
be interesting to see if irq_force_affinity() is failing. Please check
the return value and print an error
