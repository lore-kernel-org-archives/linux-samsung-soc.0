The 'new feature' is some misleading word. In this case DRM drivers
are used from v3.2 at drivers. but not registered it at board file.
Basically agree to move DT and used it finally. Before that bring up
the board using DRM based graphics.

I'm also thanks to Thomas, he did a lot of works for eyxnos. but most
parts are missing at least exynos platform.
e.g., Please see the origen.dts. I wonder it's booted with any
graphical user interface platform, android or ubuntu.
Maybe not.

Anyway, as discussed in multi-platform support mail threads, we're
also moving to DT in the big picture. but still want to use existing
boards as is.

Thank you,
