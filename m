Hi Tomasz,

Sorry for being late.

yes.

yes, for the time being i had prefered to keep it similar to
of_init_opp_table() behaviour wise.
If required both should be fixed.

Sorry, I can't see it complex as with architecture stated above
also we have to implement similar structure in drivers as we are already
doing now individually in each soc driver.

Usually we need to implement functions in drivers clearly demarking following :
1- Reading chip info (which can be done at probe time only once for all).
2- Parse/Calculate(modify) ASV group.
3- Any Group specific one time setting. eg ABB settings.
4- Parsing and modifying table ( implementing Voltage locking, if
required based on locking info bits).
