I fully agree with Sylwester. After adding mentioned fixup patches, feel 
free to add my Reviewed-by and Tested-by as well.

Yes, it would be great to have this series merged earlier, because it's 
very important for further development of Device Tree support on Samsung 
platforms. Possibly for 3.9 it could be merged as an alternative to the 
legacy clock code and after enough testing legacy code could be dropped in 
next kernel release.
