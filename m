Yes they are same because they all use the same OTG IP. This driver provides
functionalities of both host and gadget while s3c-hsotg.c is only a
gadget driver.
If you think this can be merged in s3c-hsotg to make that work in
smiler fashion
then go ahead but will that work on platforms other than ARM?

Why would we need any other driver if DWC OTG driver is working both
as host and gadget?
