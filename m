After a long road, I applied this series now to for-next. I only
squashed patches 1+2 to have the functionality in one place. And fixed a
typo in patch 1. Thanks to the testers and reviewers, and especially
Hans, for the input and discussions.

This will now get a full test cycle in -next. Let's see what happens...

And let's move on to how to add 'very late transfers without irqs' on
top of this series.

Happy hacking,

   Wolfram
