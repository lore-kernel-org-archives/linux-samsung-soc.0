Actually I think there is no nice way of making this as separate paths.
As Javier's mentioned, there aren't many differences. Currently the CPU
ordering is the only difference in DT.

Making it as separate path would create hierarchy like:
 - exynos5420-based-board.dts
   \- include: exynos5420.dtsi
      \- include: exynos5.dtsi
   \- include: exynos5420-cpu.dtsi (the cpus are not in exynos5420.dtsi)

 - exynos5422-based-board.dts
   \- include: exynos5420.dtsi
      \- include: exynos5.dtsi
   \- include: exynos5422-cpu.dtsi (the cpus are not in exynos5420.dtsi)

which of course is okay... except we keep the definition of CPUs
completely outside of main Exynos5420 DTSI. Then we have to include both
DTSI for each new DTS.

Other idea is to create artificial "exynos5420-common":
 - exynos5420-based-board.dts
   \- include: exynos5420.dtsi
       \- include: exynos5420-common.dtsi
          \- include: exynos5.dtsi
       \- include: exynos5420-cpu.dtsi

 - exynos5422-based-board.dts
   \- include: exynos5422.dtsi
      \- include: exynos5420-common.dtsi
         \- include: exynos5.dtsi
      \- include: exynos5422-cpu.dtsi

This is also confusing...

Any third idea?

KRzysztof
