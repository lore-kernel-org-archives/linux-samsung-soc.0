If 0, the host->num_slots will be set to 1. So the logic of setting default num_slots seems already there. But correct me if I am wrong.

Hmm..
Well, if i missed your reply for my removing patch, it's my fault..but i didn't see any reply..
At that time, we didn't see any usage and also now...

Are there any patches for using multi slot? 
e,g) device-tree file or your own driver

If there are big benefits to revert them,  i don't want to back them..during almost 6 years, never use it..

the second part seems that it's only support since v2.70a..?
