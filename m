Unfortunate patch 8 and 9 does *not* solve the fundamental problem
with multiple slots. You can't solve it without involving the mmc
core, as explained in earlier discussions [1].

Having multiple slots of eMMC:s, attached to one single mmc
controller, is really a terrible idea, even if one could get it to
somewhat work.

To deal with multiple slots from the mmc core point of view, we would
need to introduce  a kind of "bus slot lock", which needs to be taken
whenever the core access any of the registered two mmc hosts.

However, that then means that the upper block device layers can no
longer perform proper I/O scheduling of requests to the eMMC cards. In
other words, requests on one eMMC device can then starve requests
reaching the other eMMC device. It all falls apart.

Perhaps that is a limitation you think is okay to live with, but I am
really not so sure it's worth adding "multiple slot" support.

Kind regards
Uffe
