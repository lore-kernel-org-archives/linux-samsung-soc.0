Applied to next/dt branch. I'm not so happy about new dma channel
properties getting added to additional bindings. I guess I should
have complained earlier about these, so I'm keeping the changes
but I've added the patch below to make it clear that they will
have to change after we have agreed with Vinod and Jon on how
they should be represented.

Subject: [PATCH] ARM: EXYNOS: mark the DMA channel binding for SPI as preliminary

Bindings for DMA channels are still under discussion and will
change once this has been resolved. Therefore we mark them
the newly added ones as preliminary. Let's hope nobody starts
relying on them...
