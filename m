Are they actually interfaces to the same timer, or are they just fed by
the same system counter?

If they're the same device, then you can simply use the architected
timer, and gain all the benefits without additional code. That could
give you additional benefits (e.g. VDSO support).

For arm64 the generic timer is mandatory, and I can't imagine a case
where we wouldn't use it in preference.

ID_PFR1.GenTimer only tells you whether or not the generic timer is
implemented in the CPU, not how it's wired up (e.g. whether it shares
the system counter with the MCT), so I don't think it tells you anything
useful.

Thanks,
Mark.
