Yes, Exynos5800 Peach Pi and Exynos5420 Peach Pit IIRC.

Agreed about adding a workaround in mach code.

Yes but if we achieve #1, then I think that b.L CPUidle support should
be enabled by default in exynos_defconfig even when it does not work
on some boards (as long as don't affect negatively) so users of boards
that do work can have that feature out of the box without figuring out
what additional config options needs to be enabled.

Or that's what you meant and I misunderstood?
