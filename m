Agreed.

Ok, I understand your concern. The question is where we draw the line.

In the case of this WebCam, it's not a typical USB device in the sense
that is built in the Chromebook and not something that's plugged on an
external USB port.

There are a lot of board specific drivers that we currently enable as
built-in like hwmon sensors or iio devices that are likely only present
on a single board or a family of boards.

So then I think all those drivers should be changed as a module as well,
unless are critical for the board operation (i.e: thermal or fan drivers).

Yes, I don't see anything wrong to enable more stuff as a module if
that will give more build / test coverage.

The goal of kernelci is to add functional tests so besides testing
if a given kernel booted correctly, it's going to test if for example
USB enumeration is working and has no regressions. For that use case
is interesting to have support for the built-in USB devices like this
camera (either as built-in or as a module).

Yes, sorry for misunderstanding what you meant before.
