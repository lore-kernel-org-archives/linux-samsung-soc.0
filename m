Can you elaborate on this please ? Is that because the local timers are
not wake-up capable (shutdown) ? Or because only the IRQs targeted at CPU with
MPIDR[7:0] == 0x0 are wake-up capable ?

Does this mean that once shutdown CPU1 is stuck solid till it is poked
by CPU0, right ? Again I think this should be handled with MPIDRs, not
with cpu logical indices.

Which is a good thing and that's the way the driver should have been
implemented in the first place, thanks for posting it.

This function pointer obfuscates things, not very easy to follow.
Is there a reason why you should pass flags and run that code in
the finisher instead of running this code in the enter method for
CPU0 ? Is that a timing issue ? I do not see why running those
commands before saving the context in cpu_suspend() can make any
difference (well, apart from timing as I said), the idle functions
are already different for CPU0 and CPU1.

Again, this dependency on logical CPUs is not ideal, but I guess it is
impossible on Exynos to swap the boot CPU (or put it differently boot
on a different CPU), so we should live with that.

I've got to say MCPM could help make this code a bit more generic (I
know that already CPUs are coordinated through coupled C-states, but
this primary-secondary shutdown coordination could reuse the MCPM state
machine, I have to check).

Who clears the boot vector value ? FW ? Does this mean that CPU1 can be
reset if there is a pending IRQ for it ? That's "interesting". Since
IRQs are always affine to CPU0 and the local timer entered broadcast I
really would like to understand what IRQ can wake up CPU1 here (hardly
an IPI, CPU0 has hit the coupled barried already).

CPU1 is still in SMP mode though when it hits wfi (and it should not),
I wonder whether this plays a role here.

If we are executing here and the cluster has been shutdown, we must be sure
that CPU1 is off and I guess that's the case. If both CPUs are released
from reset and can run concurrently, there is a problem. It is related to
the enabling of the SCU, which, given your last series is supposed to be
executed in a CPU PM notifier. That code will work only if CPU1 is dead while
CPU0 reboots and I still think that enabling scu so late is a recipe for mayhem
and a bad example (not related to your clean-ups - this is true even in current
code). On platforms where all CPUs are reset on wake-up this will never ever
work, ie the SCU must be on by the time a CPU switches on its caches (because
there might be other CPUs running concurrently and they _have_ to be coherent).

To reiterate my point, CPU1 should execute this code if and only
if CPU0 has rebooted it (or idling it failed so it jumps back from
ROM code straight away and CPU0 bails out of idle too - scu is not
reset in that case).

This should be commented in detail.

More importantly, I do not see anywhere code that allows CPU1 to
clean its caches properly. While running cpu_suspend() the CPU cleans
its data cache using the LoUIS API, but it does that with the C bit
in SCTLR set, which means that it still allocates and could fetch
dirty lines from other CPUs, that's not 100% safe. So, as it is done in
arch/arm/mach-vexpress/tc2_pm.c - tc2_pm_down, core must clean its L1
with C bit in SCTLR cleared to stop allocations so that by the time
L1 cache clean is complete, the L1 data cache can't contain dirty lines.

This function pointer passing serves what purpose ? Removing platform
code dependency ? I do not see how you can avoid that given how tied
this code is to a specific platform.

BTW, you should check exynos_aftr != NULL, just in case.

Thank you !!
