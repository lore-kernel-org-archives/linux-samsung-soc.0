Ah okay.

I was expecting it to be build tested at least, to be honest. But anyway, we
will see build failures from bots if any such cases exist.

Yeah, I know. I have seen the thread and it was lack of knowledge in the
beginning which made us copy code from rest of ARM platforms. That was stupid
and there can't be any excuse for that.

Unfortunately, I don't have access to hardware to test this stuff and so
wouldn't be possible to send a patch as well.

Lets get your patch merged at least.
