As fair as I know all Exynos systems have been ported to DT. Support
for new Exynos based devices is only accepted if configuration is DT
based.

Up till now exynos has a Kbuild option to enable cpu_cooling for its
thermal subsystem.

cpufreq for Exynos also undergo major rework (done by Tomas Abraham):
"cpufreq: use generic cpufreq drivers for exynos platforms" [1]

It converts some Exynos 4 and 5 platform to use cpufreq-dt/cpufreq-bL
and is pretty close to be added in this merge window.

Unfortunately not all devices were converted (e.g. Exynos 4412) and old
legacy cpufreq code is used (I simply wait with porting Exynos4412 for
"base" patches landing in the kernel).

Although, this shouldn't be a problem.

It would be great if those patches could find their way to therma -next.
Then also Abhilash could benefit from them.

Changes, which I did recently to of-thermal.c are enough.

With this patch series I've tried to preserve previous functionality.
I've got some ideas for improvements, but those are for other
discussion.

Essentially this is a clean up, not removing support. The trick here is
that Exynos4412 (which was added first to mainline), Exynos5250 and
Exynos3250 use the same TMU IP block.

Since I don't know if [1] will be finally accepted - I've used already
available cpufreq code (with exynos_defconfig + cpu_cooling enabled).

I don't think that there should be any problem with using cpufreq-dt.
Moreover, we would have enough time for potential fixes before next
kernel (3.19) is released.
