Depends what you mean by "bridge".

I would say that it can be logically viewed as a bridge through which
graphics cards master onto the bus.

In this context it's integrated into the bus, but I think the function
it performs is still in series with, and logically distinct from, the
routing done by the bus proper.

All of which are classic functionalities of an MMU.  What is different
is that the CPU MMU is built into the CPU and standardised, and either
symmetrically shared or private to the CPU so that there is rarely if
ever any need to describe anything in DT ... whereas an IOMMU is not
tightly coupled to the CPU, and wired up to external hardware in
sometimes arbitrary ways that may require description (especially for
SoC systems).

Also agreed.  In the SoC world, the upstream and downstream paths
may be completely separate in the topology, not following the same
path at all, so then it becomes more natural for them to have
independent characteristics.  "dma-ranges" doesn't work for these
situations.

This sounds bad on the surface, but really these are permutations of a
few key concepts:

 1) Topologies that can't be reduced to a tree, resulting from
   unidirectional buses (common in SoC architectures).

 2) Many-to-many connectivity of devices, unlike the familiar
   many-to-one parent/child relationship from PCI and similar.

 3) Interconnects made up of independently configured and
   connected components, such that they can't be described as optional
   features of some standard bus.

 4) Bridge components and devices that process, route or transform
   transactions based on more than just the destination address.
   Instead, the handling of a transaction can involve some kind of
   device ID, memory type and cacheability attributes and coherency
   domain information in addition to the address.


To address these, we need a few things:

 a) A way to describe the cross-links where the topology is not
    reducible to a tree.  This would involve a phandle to describe
    a "A masters on B" relationship analogous to what the parent/
    child relationship in DT already means.

 b) For devices with multiple distinct master roles with different
    routing or behaviour in the interconnect, a way to describe those
    roles.

 c) A way to describe mappings across bridges that builds on
    "ranges" to cover a wider range of situations.

Not initially.  Ripping out old bindings that work perfectly well today
will just cause churn.  But if we can lay a good foundation for future
bindings that should help us in the future.

Probably answered by my above point.

If it ain't broke, there's no reason to fix it.

Defining DT bindings and refactoring kernel frameworks are pretty
orthogonal: we could retain compatibility with existing IOMMU bindings
within a modified framework that can also handle more diverse SoC
scenarios which may use a more uniform and sophisticated description in
the DT.

Agreed.  Because of the single-instance nature of the Intel IOMMU, and
the fact that is integrated into the interconnect in a pretty standard
way, we can get away with much less description.


I'll follow up with some more concrete details on my thinking --
hopefully that will make it a bit clearer what I mean.
