Sure it does, but this patch is about something different. It adds device 
tree based lookup (of_clk_get_by_name()) of external clocks (as opposed to 
existing lookup by name), which will fail if provider pointed by phandle 
is not registered yet.

I will send you a bunch of patches sorting out issues I found in 
clk_set_rate() path, but give me some time to prepare them :).

As for multiple clock controllers, this is going to be funny. I have 
discussed this a bit with Sylwester and we managed to find some design 
issues that I think must be solved:

a) What about multiple controllers with identical clock names? Imagine two 
PMICs that can also generate 32 KHz clocks, both having them named 
"clk32k". Am I right saying that this won't work with current code?

b) What are the rules of using clock-output-names property (and what 
should be used in non-DT case)? I can imagine using it to assign platform-
specific names of clock outputs of extra clock controllers (this would 
help in the above case of "clk32k"), but currently it seems like it is 
optional to use it in clock drivers and the meaning is provider-specific.

Best regards,
Tomasz
