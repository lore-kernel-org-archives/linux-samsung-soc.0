Hello,

On a recent disussion [0] with Krzysztof Kozlowski and Laxman Dewangan,
we came to the conclusion that the max77686 and max77802 RTC are almost
the same with only a few differences so there shouldn't be two separate
drivers and is better to extend max77686 driver and delete rtc-max77802.

By making the driver more generic, other RTC IP blocks from Maxim PMICs
could be supported as well like the max77620.

Patches #1 is just a trivial cleanup.

Patch #2 allows to support RTCs that need a shorter delay when updating
the RTC.

Patch #3 adds a driver data structure to avoid hard-coding parameters
specific to a certain RTC such as the needed delay and RTC register mask.

Patch #4 changes the driver to use a mapping table instead of using the
max77686 registers offsets directly to allow supporting RTC with other
registers addresses and layout.

Patch #5 Adds support for max77802 to max77686 RTC driver and patch #6
removes the old driver since is not needed anymore.

Finally patch #7 and patch #8 removes the Kconfig symbol from defconfigs.

I've tested this patch-set on an Exynos5800 Peach Pi Chromebook that has
a max77802 PMIC and the RTC was working correctly but I don't have a
machine with max77686 so I will really appreaciate if someone can test
that no regressions were introduced.

One thing that I'm not sure is how to handle bisectability, in patch #5
there will be two drivers that matches "rtc-max77802". So I don't know
if I should use a different platform_device_id name and change in the
same patch that max77802 is removed or if this is not a big deal so the
patches could stay as is.

I believe all patches should go through the RTC tree with proper acks or
wait until the RTC patches land to pick the defconfig changes.
