http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg367939.html

changes since v8:
	- addressed abhilash's comments to remove the restoring of 
	  the CPU0 low power state register, since it will taken care in mcpm s2r
	  patch from abhilash.

changes since v7:
	- rebased on pankaj's latest patchset.

changes since v6:
	- rebased on 3.17.rc1.

changes since v5:
	- Refactored pm.c to use DT based lookup as suggested by Tomasz Figa.

changes since v4:
	- Adressed comments from Tomasz figa and rebased on Pankaj Dubey's v5 PMU patchset

changes since v3:
Addressed the following comments from Pankaj Dubey, Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz,
Tomasz Figa and Alim Akhtar:
        - Moved EXYNOS5420_USE_STANDBY_WFI_ALL define to regs-pmu.h.
        - Merged exynos5420_set_core_flag function into powerdown_conf.
        - Removed XXTI_DURATION3 register setting.
        - Updated the commit message and ordered the clock registers in clock
          patch.
        - Removed the code for SYS_DISP1_BLK_CFG handling.
        - Modified SoC checks to A9 specific checks in PM code.
        - Updated some comments in the code and added macros for register offsets.
        - Fixed code which was changing pad retention code for older SoCs.

changes since v2:

3] with the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag for aclk200_disp1 CLK

on Exynos5420 based chromebook (peach-pit board)

Below procedures were followed to test S2R:
Procedure A:
	1. make multi_v7_defconfig 
	2  enable MCPM for 5420
	3. enable S3C RTC
	5. echo +20 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm && echo mem > /sys/power/state
Procedure B:
	1. make exynos_defconfig 
	4. echo +20 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm && echo mem > /sys/power/state
