Well it is already set to the 71th column.

Yeah, that is part of the plan. As mentioned before I want to kill thos=
e=20
variable/macro and define a cpuidle ops structure to be filled from pm.=
c.

But I would like to have this structure to be shared across the=20
different cpuidle drivers and defined in the common arm code. The=20
structure definition will depend on the different existing drivers, so =
I=20
would like to do it in a separate patchset and keep the exynos_aftr()=20
callback for the moment.

Does your comment 'those global variables' includes=20
'exynos_idle_barrier' and 'cpu1_wakeup' ?

Agree, I can find something more meaningful.

Ok, this is resulting from reverse engineering. I don't have the=20
documentation. If you can briefly summarize how it works that may help=20
to simplify/clarify the result.

Same comment than above. I guess this barrier is needed to ensure the=20
value is effectively written to BOOT_VECTOR before shutting down the co=
re.

Yes, there is a nice improvement in term of power saving for dual=20
processor. If you can clarify the BOOT_VECTOR stuff that will be nice.

I have a more recent version of the driver based on samsung-next and th=
e=20
cleanups I previously sent:

https://git.linaro.org/people/daniel.lezcano/linux.git/

branch : cpuidle/samsung-next

Thanks for the review.
