What are the difference between both versions? Is there a patch adding the 
new compatible to the driver somewhere?

Ahh, so you fixed this already in this version, thanks. Haven't noticed 
this patch at first and commented on previous one. Sorry for the noise.

You don't have to specify this property if there is only one slot. Also are 
you sure that this is a board specific property?

This property doesn't seem to be documented nor used anywhere.

Is it a board specific property?

Ditto.

Are the above three properties really board-specific?

Same for remaining nodes.
