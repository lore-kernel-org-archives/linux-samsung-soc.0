I can see this being used for diagnosing failures - e.g. hung system
would leave tracks if an interrupt was or was not provided by the
device. I can't think of a reason why Linux MSI code would need to
support this though.

Why look to the future when one can look in the past? :)

PA-RISC was designed in the 1980s to use "MSI" to generate all CPU
interrupts. This is as simple as it gets.

The concept is identical to MSI: MMIO routeable address with a payload
to indicate interrupt source (or map that source to some "vector
table".) Look at arch/parisc/kernel/smp.c:ipi_send() for an example
(note "p->hpa" is "processor->host physical address").

Current and  future products do the same things but add more
"features" that make this more complicated. But the basic transaction
will be identical and it needs to be routed like any other MMIO
transaction by any bridge (including IOMMUs).

PCI device is one "source" for MSI and PCI defines how to initialize
an MSI source.  The target is not PCI (or not even Intel). Intel
defines how MSI works on their chipsets/CPUs. Other can still do it
differently.

I'm perfectly ok with using "MSI" to refer to any "in band interrupt message".

Does the linux kernel need to know about a device/component that it
can't control?
Either linux kernel shouldn't be told about it OR should ignore this
device/component.

MMIO routing (and thus dma-ranges) is a "graph" (very comparable to
network routing). Some simple (e.g. PCI) implementations look like a
tree - but that's not the general case.

DMA cares about more than routing though - cache coherency and
performance (BW and latency) matter too.
