Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear. This has to be "arm,primecell" plus
something else. In this case, "arm,pl330". If the IP is modified from
standard ARM version (like ST likes to do), then something like
"samsung,pl330" would be appropriate.

This is not actually used by the kernel at the moment, but could if
modified versions of pl330 show up.

At least fix the "-dma-channel" part of the name. It not clear if that's
the case or just an example.

[name]-dma-channel = <[phandle of the dma controller] [dma request id]>;


The rest looks good.
