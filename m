Well timer wheel code don't support it so if you are serious,
some one needs to do that. For me, it is not worth at all.
You will have more to loose than gain with these time switching
schemes since you have to keep 2 times alive, do switching, loose
the idle time.

All of that is to save few CPU cycles since TWD is closer
compared to other SOC timer.

Anyways I will let you fight it out but IIRC, I had a
discussion a while back with tglx in one of the conference
and the conclusion was it not worth doing.
Rather TWD hardware on SOC should be made wakeup capable
and then everything is good.

Till you have support, using TWD on AM43XX will break CPUIDLE.
Not sure if it is supported or some one cares about it. Just
keep that aspect in mind.
