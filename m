Hi All,

This v6 patchset supports 4 levels of tranlsation tables for ARM64.

Firstly, the patchset introduces virtual address space size and
translation level options as taking account into the comment from
Catalin Marinas:
http://www.spinics.net/linux/lists/arm-kernel/msg319552.html

Then, it implements 4 levels of translation tables for native.

A dynamic VTTBR_X configuration is added before implementing 4 levels
for both HYP and stage2 sides.

All ARMv8 and ARMv7 related changes are validated with FastModels+kvmtool and
A15+QEMU, respectively.

Changes since v1:
- fixed unmatched data types as per Steve's comment
- removed unnecessary #ifdef in arch/arm64/mm/* as per Steve's comment
- revised create_pgd_entry to deal with PUD entry as per Steve's comment
- introduced a macro for initial memblock limit as per Steve's comment
- dropped "Fix line length exceeding 80 characters" patch as per Marc's comment
- removed unnecessary #ifdef in arch/arm/kvm/mmu.c as per Marc's comment
- added a macro for a number of objects of as per Marc's comment

Changes since v2:
- revised some macros in a generic way as per Marc's comment
- added a 2 level option for kvm mmu cache allocation as per Marc's comment

Changes since v3:
- added #ifdef to decide swapper and idmap size as per Steve's comment
- introduced Steve's create_pgd_entry

Changes since v4:
- hided translation level options from menuconfig as per Catalin's comment
- dropped some printk changes as per Mitchel's comment
- squashed VA_BITS related patches into a single patch

Changes since v5:
- added dynamic VTTBR_X configuration logic
- removed a redundant logic in stage2_set_pte as per Christoffer's comment
- added comments for create_pud_entry as per Christoffer and Steve's comment
- fixed typos in 4 level descriptions as per Christoffer's comment
- revised arm64 Kconfig help message as per Christoffer's comment
- rebased on top of for-next/core branch of arm64/linux.git

Jungseok Lee (7):
  arm64: Use pr_* instead of printk
  arm64: Introduce VA_BITS and translation level options
  arm64: Add a description on 48-bit address space with 4KB pages

  arm64: KVM: Set physical address size related factors in runtime
  arm64: KVM: Implement 4 levels of translation tables for HYP and
    stage2
