Thanks to you, Issue is now figured out. This was due to generic Power 
Domain code added recently. SYSMMU registers were not getting enabled 
due to this. I reverted the PD changes from the machine to architecture 
specific, and voila, SYSMMU is back into action using the 
dma-mapping-v7. I will have to see how the same would behave when the 
complete PD changes comes to mainline from maintainers for-next in future.
