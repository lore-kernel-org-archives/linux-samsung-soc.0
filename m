This really doesn't make a lot of sense to me, so I'm still kinda
confused.  If you want to call it good then that's your (and Ulf's)
decision, but it's the kind of thing that would keep me up at night.
How can this pin be high if all the regulators pulling it up are off?
Is there a current leak somewhere and that's why it's working?

How this is supposed to work (as I understand it):

1. When no card is inserted then this pin is supposed to be pulled up
to VDDQ_MMC2.  That could be either an internal or an external pullup.
It should be pulled up to VDDQ_MMC2 (as opposed to any other voltage)
since the exynos manual documents that this pin lives in the VDDQ_MMC2
io domain.  Note that it could be pulled up externally to a different
supply than the one going to VDDQ_MMC2, but for correctness it should
be the same voltage.

2. When a card is inserted, the pin will be grounded (AKA this is an
open drain pin).


With your patch, can you probe the pin and see if card detect is high
when all the regulators are off?  Any idea how it gets high?  If you
turn off the internal pullup is it still high?
