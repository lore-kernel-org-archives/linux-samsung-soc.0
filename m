Hi Sylwester,

Thanks for your reply!

The fact that you need pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() is really worrying.
That indicates that exynos are suffering from this race condition I am
trying to fix in this patchset.

Why would runtime PM callbacks be invoked when the device are runtime
PM active? That's prevented by the runtime PM core and is the expected
behaviour.

pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() is not the solution, besides that it gives
you the option to lie about device's runtime PM state to genpd. Thus,
if you are really lucky, that might workaround your issues. :-)

I will happily help out in fixing drivers for exynos. Would be nice if
you could provide me with a list of which driver/subsystems that seems
broken. HW, wise I have a exynos 5250 and exynos 5422 on my desk, so
those I can test.

Yes.

I would really appreciate if you could run a test with the complete
patchset and see if that resolves the issues.

Kind regards
