I notice that there's no way to tell what revision of SCU is implemente=
d
on _any_ mpcore platform.

In light of that, I think there's no point what so ever trying to
consolidate this code - even the control register bits vary in
unpredictable ways between different MPcore implementations.

So we can't say "this is a SCU X and this is its register layout."

And really, having it undetectable except via DT (which from what I
can see, isn't happening any time soon) or via a command line argument
isn't acceptable.

So I think the idea of consolidating the SCU code is a lost cause.
