Fair enough.

Right

Alright, so DWC3 (or any other consumer of PHY) should do minimal to
handle runtime state of PHYs; get() when accessing PHY and put() when it's done
with it.

Yes, ofcourse there's a routine usb_phy_shutdown(). So this will be
calling put_sync()
to put PHYs back to its initialized state. Right ?
