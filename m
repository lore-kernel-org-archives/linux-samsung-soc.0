In fact we have to deal with the opposite now, as some existing drivers
have been used for multiple generations of SoC, where almost unchanged
device IPs are deployed. Those drivers were originally written for the
simplest SoCs.

Yeah, makes a lot of sense. With new code there is no issue, only the code
with long history is sort of troublesome.
