This will improve the robustness of the device registration process,
but I wonder if it's really worth the efforts of complicating the amba
device registration code.

The problem I see with such approach, is to know *when* shall we retry
to register the devices.

We will rely on the PM domain driver to be probed, as to have the
corresponding OF genpd provider registered, else the device
registration will continue to fail.
Now, I don't think there are PM domain drivers as removable modules
(yet), but in such cases a late_initcall won't help much.

I agree!

Although I think with some adjustments, perhaps we can move forward with v1?

The adjustments I think is needed:
Instead of propagating the error code from dev_pm_domain_attach(),
let's print a debug message and continue the device registration.
In that way, we shouldn't introduce regressions for cases where the OF
genpd provider hasn't yet been registered, but the issue Marek is
trying to solve for Exynos should be fixed.

What do you think?

Kind regards
Uffe
