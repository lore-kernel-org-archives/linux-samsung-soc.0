All the SoC peripherals have been put into the soc node and ranges
property in that node is used to convert 64-bit to 32-bit addresses.
But since this is a 64-bit SoC, we use #address-cells as 2.

This is only describing the hardware and it does not depend on linux
using this information. And support for chip id can be used later for
64-bit Exynos platforms as well.

That is programmed by the bootloader / firmware.
