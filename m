correct.

hmm.. ok.

Actually this is needed for non-dt boot case. In the case of dt boot, we use a
phandle by which the controller can get a reference to the phy. But in the case
of non-dt boot, the controller can get a reference to the phy only by label.

You are right. Valid pointer check can be done in controller code as well.
