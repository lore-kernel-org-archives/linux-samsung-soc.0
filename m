The first batch sent by Doug did indeed touch this driver and the patches
were merged through the MFD tree for 3.17 as you said. I see that your
next branch is based on 3.16-rc6 and that is why it does not apply cleanly.

I guess you will rebase your next branch for 3.18 on top of 3.17-rc1
anyways which will fix this issue? If not please let me know and I can of
course re-spin the patch so it applies cleanly on top of 3.16-rc6.
