In addition to PHY handling,it also deals with the special clock
sclk_sata which is not dealt in ahci_platform.c(certainly exynos
specific).

Morever there is a wrapper driver to handle the platform specific
things for the sata.Please refer the  patch[1]
[1]ata: ti_sata: Add Texas Instruments SATA Wrapper driver
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/19/166

[2]ahci_imx: add ahci sata support on imx platforms

I think, if we have platform specific driver like ahci_xxx.c , it
would be better to handle the sata PHY in ahci_xxx.c so that we can
retain and re-use the ahci_platform.c as it is.

Further comments will be much appreciated.
