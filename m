The Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-samsung.txt
describes "cs-gpio" as a controller specific property.

The dts entries for SPI in exynos4412-trats2.dts, exynos4210-smdkv310.dts
and exynos5250-smdk5250.dts boards have the "cs-gpio" property defined
under controller-data node, which is inside the SPI device node
&spi_1 {
  controller-data {
    cs-gpio = <>;
  };
};

But, _probe() of spi-s3c64xx.c driver looks for "cs-gpio" in the SPI
device node and
sets a flag "sdd->cs_gpio = false" (If the property is not available)
&spi_1 {
  cs-gpio = <>;
};

the sdd->cs_gpio flag is checked before actually getting the gpios
from the controller-data node
       if (sdd->cs_gpio)
                cs->line = of_get_named_gpio(data_np, "cs-gpio", 0);

Hence, SPI was failing on those boards.

1. As the SPI core and several drivers were changed to work with
    DT property "cs-gpios" (plural) defined under SPI node.
2. Since the commit 3146beec21b64f4551fcf0ac148381d54dc41b1b
    "spi: s3c64xx: Added provision for dedicated cs pin"
    Dated:   Fri Jun 21 11:26:12 2013 +0530

For the above 2 reasons, It was decided to drop the backward compatibility
of using "cs-gpio"(singular) in controller-data.
Instead, start supporting "cs-gpios"(plural) in the SPI node.

using gpio_is_valid() to "sdd->cs_gpio" flag every where to check for the
validity was a review comment.
Which seems to fail for internal chip select with zero.

I can submit another version with"sdd->cs_gpio" flag for this purpose.
