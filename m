No. We don't have any tests at all :)

Yeah, tests are welcomed but the question is where should they get added.
Don't know if its common to add tests directly to kernel.

And also if the test is really good, not discouraging your work.

What I meant to say was, your subject and body must be good enough
to answer most of the things. You don't have to tell much about the
implementation but other things should be pretty clear from logs.

Your current logs are quite short for something that's not a normal practice.

Yeah, a README is welcomed and would be useful for users as well..

Shouldn't you use userspace governor then instead of performance?
And then we don't need the gzip stuff at all. We can just set it to the
right freq and get current freq to see if it matches?

And now that we are starting to get tests added into the kernel (will still
wait to see what Rafael has to advice), we better think of the way these
are going to get added. Probably a single script with parameters like
what to test?

Yeah, that would be fine. Probably need to think more about scripts name.
