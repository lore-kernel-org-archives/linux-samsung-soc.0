I'm a bit puzzled here.

If the GIC change broke something on your platform, it probably also
broke something for all other users of arch_send_wakeup_ipi_mask. But
nobody reported anything until now. Also, it doesn't look like 4210 is a
big-little platform, so it is unlikely to use the big-little switcher.

What is specific to this system that makes misbehave? Were you
implicitly relying on the BL lock to perform some serialization?

Thanks,
