Linux should provide clues about what's needed in a binding, but the
binding should not be defined based on current Linux code. Doing the
binding one way and changing it later is not a good plan.

I think you need to convert all users of gpio over as well so you can
move to dynamic gpio_chip creation and gpio numbering. Or maybe you can
match based on base address? This is going to be a common problem as
gpio is converted over to DT. Perhaps Grant or others have suggestions
on the approach to use.
