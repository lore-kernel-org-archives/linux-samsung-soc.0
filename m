While we're making these changes, it would be good to take to opportunity
to add a #define for these bits too.

The magic numbers here meant that I had to do some guesswork to
understand the real behaviour here, and someone reading the code in the
future is likely to have the same problem...

I agree with this.

If a wait is needed anywhere, it is

 a) in power_down_finish(), and
 b) *before* the call to exynos_core_power_control() in
        exynos_core_power_up() (see below for explanation)

Any waits should not be busy-waits either: we should use msleep or
similar.  This is fine that we only wait from contexts that can sleep --
I think this is OK for the power_up() and power_down_finish() paths
(which aren't executed on the target CPU), but not on the power_down()
path.

Busy-waiting for 1ms every time we power a CPU down is not great for
power-saving...

In both cases, we should check the PMU status bits first, and only
wait if they are not already in the desired state.  The most likely
case will always by that the target CPU already caught up.


Nico currently disagrees with me on (b), so we need to explore that
(below).

To extend this argument further, there is no conceiveable situation
where we would need to wait for power_up to complete explicitly.

We will only ever need to wait for power_down to complete.

For (b), I think we're still missing some information here...

Suppose CPU0 is powering down.  The PMU has been told to power the CPU
down, and CPU0 has released edcs_lock.  Suppose soon afterwards, CPU1
wants to turn CPU0 back on again.

Now, unless CPU1 checks the power controller status, CPU1 has no way
to know whether the power-down request is still in progress before CPU1
issues a new power-up request for CPU0.

Now, what behaviour does the power controller guarantee when it is still
in this state, and a new power-up request is issued to it?

I worry that the power controller may not cope with a new request while
in this state, or may not guarantee predictable behaviour.  If so then
the new power-up request may just get lost -- avoiding that problem
requires power_up() to wait for a pending power_down() to finish before
issuing a new command to the power controller.

Only the hardware documentation can answer this question.

Cheers
