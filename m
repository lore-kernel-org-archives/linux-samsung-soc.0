The mentioned lockdep warning is a false positive. Such warning is 
reported for
every subdomain present in a system. As you noticed that removing dependency
between power domains also removes this warning, but it will introduce real
problems with power on/off sequences of graphics devices.

I will send a patch for genpd core fixing the deplock warning. Thanks for
reporting the issue and pointing a good place to start digging in the 
source :)

Best regards
