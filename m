Hold on, no I don't agree. sti_hda.c does create a bridge for it's own
internal use. It does not drm_bridge_add it, because all that ever does
is adding the bridge to the global lost of bridges. But since this is
a bridge for internal use, there is little point in calling drm_bridge_add,
the driver currently gains nothing by doing so.

But, drm_bridge_add might be a good place to put common stuff for every
bridge in the system, so it might be worthwhile to start requiring all
bridges to be drm_bridge_add-ed. And IMHO, it would not be wrong to have
the sti-hda driver call drm_bridge_add on the bridge it creates.

Do you really think it is actively wrong to call drm_bridge_add for
internal bridges such as this?

Cheers,
Peter
