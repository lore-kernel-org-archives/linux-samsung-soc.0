Hi Olof,

In my opinion, as you know, it would be better to us if you could send this in this merge window.
Actually, it does not have any dependency with others, in addition, for a long time this has been included in linux-next for this
merge window.
If this can be missed from sending list to Linus, please kindly let me know. Let me send this to Linus at the end of this merge
window.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
