I wonder if that's because I didn't push my tree out until Tuesday-ish.
It takes around 48 hours between when I push stuff out to it appearing
in linux-next, which is not particularly desirable, but unavoidable due
to timezone differences.

I did decide that I wouldn't push it out the same day I merged it because
I wanted it to run through my build/boot system, which it did successfully,
but then my OMAP4 build doesn't have CPU idle enabled (and as you've
identified, when CPU idle is disabled, it works.)

The problem there is that if I decide not to push some merged changes out,
it takes several days before I get around to touching the kernel tree
again.  Hence why it took from Thursday until Tuesday for it to eventually
get pushed out.
