Hi Tobias,

First of all, thanks for your test.

As you thought, when maintaining lower clock of memory bus frequency,
some issue related to multimedia feature will happen.

Separately, We have to check the miminum lower clock for working of multimedia feature.
and then multimedia or other IP have to request it to DVFS driver (memory busfreq driver).
But, latest mainline kernel currently has not some way to inform minimum clock to DVFS driver.

So, If you check the miminum clock for hdmi, I'll use this clock as minumu frequency of dvfs table.

Thanks,
Chanwoo Choi
