While this will actually fix the module auto-load issue on the atmel driver,
I'm concerned that the I2C core is not reporting the correct module
'of:N*T*Catmel,maxtouch*' alias when probing using DT.

Since as Lee said on his cover letter for the mentioned series [0], an I2C ID
table shouldn't be mandatory for drivers that only support DT based platforms
(e.g: a driver that depends on OF) but in that case I2C module auto-loading
would not work AFAICT.

Best regards,
Javier
