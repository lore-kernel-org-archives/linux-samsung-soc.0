Thanks for the clarification, this is due to the implicit sort you
had explained (and I provided notes for on ksummit-discuss) right?

Can you itemize a few of the workarounds that are used today?
As you clarify below, getting this order of device registration
correct does not necessarily guarantee devices will wait for their
provider to be ready.

Thanks this helps as well!

Is the fact that its not on shutdown just because we don't care about
being sloppy about shutdown ? Shouldn't some devices care about that
order ?
