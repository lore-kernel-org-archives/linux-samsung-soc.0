With this branch now available (merged) in linux-next (20130422),
looks like exynos4 DT support is broken on it. Tested on Origen 4210
and 4412 and I get the following warnings on 4412 Origen board with
exynos_defconfig (Note that clocks are all 0). However, it boots fine
on Arndale board.

SLUB: HWalign=64, Order=0-3, MinObjects=0, CPUs=2, Nodes=1
Preemptible hierarchical RCU implementation.

Exynos4x12 clocks: sclk_apll = 0, sclk_mpll = 0
        sclk_epll = 0, sclk_vpll = 0, arm_clk = 0
