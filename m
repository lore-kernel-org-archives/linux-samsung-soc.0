Yes, I see the same problem with all the files I tested.

I thought the problem was not a missing master clock, but an invalid clock
frequency. Since the error message in the patch change log was:

"max98090 7-0010: Invalid master clock frequency"

But what I tried to ask was what else was missing to have playback working.

No worries, I was asked in case you had more information. Audio is the
only thing that is missing to have all peripherals working correctly with
mainline.

Do you mean to revert $SUBJECT and "2fad972d45c4" to see if the bootloader
sets this correctly? If I revert both patches then I have no audio at all.

Yes, the downstream 3.8 ChromiumOS tree has also a machine driver but I
don't see a simple-audio-card in that tree so it seems that predates it.
