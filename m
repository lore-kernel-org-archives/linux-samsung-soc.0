This is a completely separate discussion, the problem at hand doesn't
have anything to do with building a kernel for multiple mach-*
directories combined that I was referring to in the text you quote.

I think it's a good idea to make new features DT-only because this
way we don't get any regressions and everyone who want to use
the new feature will be able to test the DT support on his board.

This of course requires that basic DT support is available for the
systems in question so we don't regress when moving away from the
old board files. My impression is that we're getting close to that
point on exynos thanks to Thomas' work on this. AFAICT we don't
have a DT binding for screen timings yet, so you will still have
to use auxdata for that or put the timings into the driver.
