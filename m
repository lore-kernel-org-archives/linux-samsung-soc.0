Thanks for your comment ;)

Yeah, bridge/ have been add four new files for this driver, it would be 
better to
collect into a separate folder.

I'm wondering should I just name the folder with "analogix_dp/", or we 
can make
it more common (like "analogix/")? (personally I do like the last one)

Thanks,
