Do we need to consider this case?
I don't think a device can have different contexts at the same time.
If there such device is in a system, its driver must handle it correctly
with different devices descriptors for the different contexts, for example.
I mean, if a device has two DMA ports that are in different contexts,
they can be treated as different devices which are handed by a driver.

I worry that abstracting everything we can think may make the problem harder.
