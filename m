The problem here will be that at boot the PWM runs at full duty. With
the current exynos PWM drive if you disable the PWM it will stop pulsin=
g
but remain high if it was at 100% duty. My patch on which you depend
upon fixed a race  where disabling the pwm right after changing the dut=
y
cycle (e.g. to 0%) also kept the signal high.=20

=46rom looking at other PWM users at the time it seemed that most if no=
t
all always first set to duty to 0% and then disable the pwm. Which
should work fine on exynos now. However iirc Thierry recently clarified
that the expected result of pwm_disable is not just that the modulation
stops but also that the output signal goes low, although that's not ver=
y
explicit in the current pwm documentation.. The exynos PWM driver will
need another fix tweak to make that true.
