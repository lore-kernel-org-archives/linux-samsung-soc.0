There's one really nice thing about having an "exynos_defconfig".  It
makes it a little easier to tease apart what's actually needed if you
just want to build a product kernel that support exynos.

Most product kernels shipping in embedded devices only support one or
maybe a small number of SoCs.  If you need to try to figure out what
parts of the "multi_v7" config is relevant then it's very hard.

It's also nice to help measure multiplatform code bloat.  You can keep
measuring the output kernel size of the exynos kernel to see how much
bloat all of the mutliplatform stuff has added.

Death by 1000 cuts is a very painful death indeed, even if each cut is small.
