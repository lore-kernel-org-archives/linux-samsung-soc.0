I have reviewed this series and there are several comments that I'd like 
to ask you to address. Please see my replies to particular patches.

However, this driver, even after applying your series, is still far from 
a state that would allow it to be enabled. The most important issue is 
direct access to CMU registers, based on static mapping, which is not 
allowed on multiplatform kernels and multiplatform-awareness for drivers 
is currently a must.

To allow this driver to be enabled, it needs to be converted to use 
common clock framework functions to configure all clocks, e.g. 
clk_set_rate(), clk_set_parent(), etc., without accessing CMU registers 
directly.

Of course as long as the driver is effectively unusable, to keep 
development, we can proceed with refactoring it step-by-step and your 
series would be basically the first step, after addressing the review 
comments.

Best regards,
Tomasz
