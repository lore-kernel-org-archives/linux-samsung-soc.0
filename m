Hmm...Don't understand what this means. If you can explain, that
would be better, so I would not miss your suggest.  :-)

Thanks for your correct. I prefer to take the last one  ;)

Yes, those 10+ patches do base on the previous changes, specially when =
I
rebase my series on the latest linux-next branch.

Besides, I don't know that how to send parts of this series, and keep t=
he
unrelated patches no send. For example if the [v4 03/16] ~ [v4 10/16]
need  update to v5, and [v4 11/16] ~ [v4 16/16] keep in v4.
So should I only send the [v5 03/16]  ~ [v5 10/16], no need to send and
update [v4 11/16] ~ [v4 16/16] to v5 ?

If so I think it would be difficult for guys to comment, cause they=20
can't see
the whole series in one reply list .   ;)

Thanks,
