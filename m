Yes, I know that. My point was that the platforms were either not using the
mmc-pwrseq-emmc or their system restart handler already had a lower priority
but that is not true for at least rk3288-veyron as you said.

The behavior is going to change indeed in that board but no due probe
order but because the gpio-restart handler dev node has priority = <200>
which overrides the default 129 in the gpio-restart driver.

So before $SUBJECT the eMMC restart handler was not executed but now it
will be after this change.

Agreed.

Yes, I never meant that the patch should be merged without testing...

Agreed, I missed that rk3288-veyron is using a restart handler with higher
priority and could be other boards too as you said.

Let's see what is Marek's opinion since he added the pwrseq_emmc support
and also what Ulf thinks about always doing a eMMC reset before reboot.

I can't think how doing a eMMC card reset before reboot could affect a
board but you are right that we don't know without testing.
