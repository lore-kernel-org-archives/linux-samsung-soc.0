Fallout from a rebase? That latter part doesn't seem to be relevant.

Can we guarantee everything going to live within 0x0 - 0xffffffff for
all boards using the SoC?

I suspect that we can't, so the addresses and sizes at the top level
should be two cells. At some point there is bound to be something above
4GB that we'll need to map, so to save us from a painful dts refactoring
we should have the dts organised to support that from the outside.

Nice to see GICV and GICH.

I don't see why need the map here. Why can't we describe the GIC
interrupts directly?

Your firmware/bootloader should configure CNTFRQ, and this shouldn't be
necessary. The clock-frequency property is an incomplete workaround for
broken firmware that in an ideal world we could kill off.

Neither of these properties were introduced by this series, and no
rationale was given.

What are these properties for, and why do you believe they are
necessary?

Thanks,
Mark.
