Uhm, I was convinced that this patch was already in. So I think your use
case is definitely a good reason to get back to this patch and use the
facility it provides to solve your problem.

I'd prefer this one, as stated above. I think the reasons are obvious:
no made up devices and re-using infrastructure useful for other purposes
as well.

Right, ideally the firmware should be making operating system's life
easier not harder, but we all know that even if there are examples of
good firmware, there will always be the opposite as well... So the
kernel should be able to work anyway.

This could be also handled by adding a sleep hog, i.e. "sleep" state for
the pinctrl device itself and adding proper suspend/resume callbacks to
the pinctrl-samsung driver (I'm not sure whether a call to
pinctrl_select_state() would work in syscore ops).
