of_platform_populate() is too early to do the association, because that 
time the
exynos iommu driver is even not yet probed.

The association with default dma-mapping domain is done in
IOMMU_GROUP_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER notifier, just before binding the driver 
to the
given device. This way iommu driver can check dev->driver->flags and 
skip creating
default dma-mapping domain if driver announces that it wants to handle it by
itself.
