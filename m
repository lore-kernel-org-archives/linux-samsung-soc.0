This series intends to add support for L2 cache on Exynos4 SoCs on boards
running under secure firmware, which requires certain initialization steps
to be done with help of firmware, as selected registers are writable only
from secure mode.

First four patches extend existing support for secure write in L2C driver
to account for design of secure firmware running on Exynos. Namely:
 1) direct read access to certain registers is needed on Exynos, because
    secure firmware calls set several registers at once,
 2) not all boards are running secure firmware, so .write_sec callback
    needs to be installed in Exynos firmware ops initialization code,
 3) write access to {DATA,TAG}_LATENCY_CTRL registers fron non-secure world
    is not allowed and so must use l2c_write_sec as well,
 4) on certain boards, default value of prefetch register is incorrect
    and must be overridden at L2C initialization.
For boards running with firmware that provides access to individual
L2C registers this series should introduce no functional changes. However
since the driver is widely used on other platforms I'd like to kindly ask
any interested people for testing.

Further two patches add impelmentation of .write_sec for Exynos secure
firmware and necessary DT nodes to enable L2 cache.

Tested on Exynos4210-based Universal C210 and Trats (both without secure
firmware) and Exynos4412-based TRATS2 and ODROID-U3 boards (both with secure
firmware).

Depends on:
 - [PATCH] ARM: make it easier to check the CPU part number correctly
   (http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/335126
    already in linux-next)
 - [PATCH v2 0/2] Firmware-assisted suspend/resume of Exynos SoCs
   (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/17/431)

Changes since v2:
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/6/25/416)
 - refactored L2C driver to use commit-like interface and make it no longer
   depend on availability of writes to individual registers,
 - moved L2C resume to assembly code, because doing it later makes some
   systems unstable - this is also needed for deeper cpuidle modes,
 - dropped unnecessary patch hacking around the .write_sec interface,
 - dropped patch making the driver use l2c_write_sec() for LATENCY_CTRL
   registers as Exynos is no longer affected and I'm not aware of any
   reports that this is also needed on other platforms (can be applied
   separately if it turns out to be so),
 - rebased onto next-20140717 tag of linux-next tree.

Changes since v1:
(https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-omap@vger.kernel.org/msg106323.html)
 - rebased onto for-next branch of linux-samsung tree,
 - changed argument order of outer_cache.write_sec() callback to match
   l2c_write_sec() function in cache-l2x0.c,
 - added support of overriding of prefetch settings to work around incorrect
   default settings on certain Exynos4x12-based boards,
 - added call to firmware to invalidate whole L2 cache before setting enable
   bit in L2C control register (required by Exynos secure firmware).
