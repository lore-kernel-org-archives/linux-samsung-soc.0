Hi Arnd,

Thanks for review and suggestions.

OK. Will move to "drivers/soc". I can see already some patches
have been posted [1] by Andy Gross for creating directory
"drivers/soc" I will use those patches for adding samsung folder
under "drivers/soc".

OK. Will update in next version.

Currently I can't see soc nodes in exynos4 and exynos5 DT files.
So isn't it should be a separate patch first to modify all exynos4
exynos5 DT files to move all devices under soc node?
In that case existing chipid node will be also moved under soc node.

Is it necessary in this case?
As I have mentioned there is difference in bit-mask among exynos4
and exynos5's chipid. So is this reason not sufficient to keep separate
compatible for both?
Also even if we get some way to preserve existing compatibility, I afraid
in chipid driver that implementation will not look good, at least I am not
able to think of any good way. Any suggestions?

I agree with what you are trying to say. But if you see recently we had some
patches (cpu_idle.c: [2], pmu.c: [3])  to remove usage of such macros from
exynos machine files. So only leftover files using these macros are exynos.c
platsmp.c and pm.c.

For exynos.c I have tried to remove soc_is_exynos4/exynos5 by matching with
compatible string in patch 1 of this series. Please let me know if that is OK?

Also for platsmp.c and pm.c I can think of following approaches
1: Keep these macros till we get generic solution?
2: Allow chipid driver to expose APIs to check SoC id and SoC revisions 
till we get
generic solution. So that at least we can remove #ifdef  based macros
as soc_is_exynosXYZ.
3: Use of "of_flat_dt_is_compatible" or similar APIs in these machine files 
till we get
generic solution. For some cases where we want to know SoC revision let us
map chipid register and get revision there itself.

Please let me know what approach you think will be good?
