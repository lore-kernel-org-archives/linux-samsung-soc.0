Yes you can and I covered this situation in my email.  In that case,
you _define_ CONFIG_PL310_ERRATA_769419 such that the barrier _always_
gets included both both platforms.

As I already said, there is _no_ point making the barrier conditional;
it's probably more expensive to make it conditional than just to execute
it every time.  But we still might as well optimize it away if we are
running _only_ on platforms which _do_ _not_ have that errata.
