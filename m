Right, Reason why i posted this patch myself fixing the nits (As Leela
and i work closely)
Should have been along with the set.

Will make a note of it.

TMU hardware on Exynos5440 and Exynos5420 has two different abnormalities
On Exynos5440 Some registers are interleaved between the channels
On Exynos5420, TRIMINFO is misplaced between, channels 2, 3 and 4.

having second_base was for the fix by Amit to address Exynos5440 problem,
Which was already merged.
After several reviews i tried to solve it by reusing the second_base
for Exynos5420 aswell.
Hence, I tried to use the "clk_sec" or "clk_second" which will rhyme
along with the
"second_base" in the driver.

I'm still not sure this having second clock is needed for Exynos5440 aswell.
Will figure it out tomorrow.
