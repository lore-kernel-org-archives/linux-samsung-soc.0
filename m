We are also interested in improving mainline support for C100 series as
well as upcoming C110.

So most of the current code from plat-s3c (mainly common dev-* platform
resources, clocks, uart and gpio core functions) would be moved to
plat-samsung? Right?

These multiple plat-* directories for all Samsung chip series are in
fact a big overhead for kernel tree. I assume that You want to end with
only one plat-samsung directory. Am I right? What about multiple mach-*
directories (mach-s3c2400, ..., mach-s3c24a0, mach-s3c6400, mach-s3c6410,
mach-s5pc100, ...)? Do you plan to keep them? Maybe a multilevel structure
would be more aproperiate? (mach-samsung/s3c2400, mach-samsung/s3c6400, 
and so on)?

How do you plan to handle different includes, register map, register
offset defines, etc in each chip series? Would this result in moving
the series specific include directories to mach-* directories?

How can we adapt the current plat-s5pcxx code to better match the
migration to common plat-samsung directory?
