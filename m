As context, this is part of the work that I am currently doing with
Samsung to improve the mainlining of the newer SoC series. Part of this
is to try and cut down on the amount of repetition that gets done by
some of the porting teams. This is generally to stop things like the
replication of the serial drivers or ending up with complete new copies
of the SDHCI core simply because they could.
