Ok. Understood why you have mentioned such.

If it is required to map frame buffers for the System MMU of a specific window,
you can specify different phandles to mmu-masters of sysmmu_fimd0w04 and
sysmmu_0w123.

However, I think it is more convenient that all windows of a FIMD share the
same virtual address space because
 - Exynos5250: FIMD has one System MMU
 - Exynos5420: FIMD has 2 System MMUs for Window 0,4 and 1,2,3
 - Another SoC which is not ready for upstreaming: FIMD has 2 System MMUs for window 0,1 and 2,3,4
(I also discouraged when I found a new Soc has different H/W bus topology :)

For this reason, I prefer allowing a single master to have multiple System MMU.

As I mentioned above, drivers can control every System MMU separately.

Thank you.
