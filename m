No, I don't think we can... there is a certain amount of "firmware got
things working for us, and we're going to use it for a while" that is
absolutely reasonable. simplefb is a good example, but there are
certainly others.

I /do/ think it would be better for the simplefb data to get embedded
or linked into the node of the graphics controller so that it can be
torn down appropriately, and we need a rule for how long boot-state
can be considered valid so that a proper driver can either reserve the
resources for a given SoC, or do a full handoff from the simplefb.
Even without that though, we need to be able to handle the case of an
anonymous simplefb node with no regulator information. If that means
the default simplefb behaviour is to inhibit runtime pm on all
resources until a real driver show up, then that might just be what we
need to do.

Two things should probably be changed from the current setup. 1)
simplefb shouldn't be a platform driver. It is a boot thing that
handles initial state from the graphics chip. By implementing it as a
platform driver, it prevents the real driver from binding to the real
device if the simplefb data embedded into it. 2) make sure that an SoC
driver can protect the needed resources before they are automatically
disabled. Either by putting them in an earlier initcall, or handling
it in the subsystem code. I don't know enough about the regulator and
clock runtime PM to know what the best way to do this is.
