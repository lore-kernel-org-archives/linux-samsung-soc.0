Sorry for the delay, I'm travelling this week.

FWIW, the same CPU boot failures you hilight above are happening on
multi_v7_defconfig[1] which is not getting the imprecise abort.  This is
only happening on exynos_defconfig[2], so I'm curious why you think the
switcher or NR_CPUS might be the issues.

Anyways, I narrowed this down a bit and discovered it's
CONFIG_EXYNOS5420_MCPM=y that's the root cause.  If I use
exynos_defconfig and then disable that option, I don't get any more
imprecise aborts.
