Interesting thing can be found in exynos5420.dtsi:
mdma1: mdma@11C10000 {
	...
	/*
	 * MDMA1 can support both secure and non-secure
	 * AXI transactions. When this is enabled in the kernel
	 * for boards that run in secure mode, we are getting
	 * imprecise external aborts causing the kernel to oops.
	 */
	status = "disabled";
};

I am booting Arndale Octa on some other config and exynos. However with
or without MCPM the imprecise aborts are still present (but not fatal,
shell comes up).

My board boots also under secure firmware (I am using Linaro's ubuntu
image). Maybe that is the cause?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
