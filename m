I still think that we can do better with this - especially once the
crappy situation with the hotplug CPU code gets resolved.

The SCU does not require the pen_release code.  What currently requires
that is the hotplug CPU code to allow offlined CPUs to be re-woken.  If
these CPUs can be properly shutdown, and brought back online via their
reset vector, they can be brought back online via the same method used
for their initial boot.

What that means is, as we send each individual CPU an IPI, we don't
need the pen_release mess nor the holding pen, and all this code can go.

If all that code is tied into a generic "SCU" support option, then we
have to ensure that _all_ SCU using platforms can use this method before
we switch to it, rather than doing it on a per-platform basis as we can
now.
