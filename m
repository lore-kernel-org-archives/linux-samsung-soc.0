Good point, I will rewrite them into two bool vars.

This align stuff was again taken from omap driver. AES code does not need
any DMA_ALIGN, it sets ".cra_align = 0x0f", but it is not needed, it can be
simple zero 0x00, as AES operate on blocks of 64 bytes long, and SecSS DMA
engine can operate on non-aligned addresses. I am not sure how CPU will
handle HASH corner case at last update, when input data will point to last
byte of page, length will be 1, and FeedControl will round up length to 8,
so DMA will try (?) reading bytes after page.
To sum it up, AES code needs cleanup ".cra_align = 0", but I do not think
it is so critical to make it before HASH.

You have good point here, as the names are confusing, so I will remove
SSS_ALIGNED from HASH struct definitions, and change SSS_DMA_ALIGN into
SSS_HASH_DMA_LEN_ALIGN, and SSS_DMA_ALIGN_MASK into SSS_HASH_DMA_ALIGN_MASK.

Sorry, I will remove this cleanup (line is 81 bytes long).

OK, I will reformat comments up to 80 bytes per line, this one and following
ones.

You are right, I did not check this with EXYNOS_HASH disabled, I will
rewrite it.

There is .registered field which is incremented with each algo register.
I can move assignes to fields .import, .export and .statesize into struct.
When I tried add const, I got compiler warn:
drivers/crypto/s5p-sss.c: In function ‘s5p_aes_remove’:
drivers/crypto/s5p-sss.c:2397:6: warning: passing argument 1 of ‘crypto_unregister_ahash’ discards ‘const’ qualifier from pointer target type [-Wdiscarded-qualifiers]
      &hash_algs_i[i].algs_list[j]);
so it was not designed to be const (in crypto framework).
In AES code the alg struct is also static:
static struct crypto_alg algs[] = {

What you mean by 'stick the driver to only one instance' ? In Exynos 4412 there
is only one SecSS block, in some other Exynos there is SlimSS, but it is not
the same (it has lower capabilities and other io addresses), so there should not
be two s5p_aes_dev drivers loaded at the same time.

OK, I will use it.
