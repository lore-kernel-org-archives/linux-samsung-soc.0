Yes, I agree. It will be better to reduce the custom bindings.

Yes, they are mean the same.

"samsung,sdhci-cd-gpio" and "sdhci-cd-internal" both use the cd-gpio line.

"samsung,sdhci-cd-gpio" means that the cd-gpio line is not connected
to the card-detect pad of the sdhci controller. Instead, it identifies
cd-gpio as a gpio pin, connected to the card-detect pin of the "card
slot" and it can used as a source of external interrupt. The driver
can register card insert/remove handler for this interrupt and get
notified about the changes in card state.

"sdhci-cd-internal" means that the "cd-gpio" line is used to connect
the card-detect pin of the card slot and the card-detect pad of the
sdhci controller. The controller is then aware of any changes in card
state and the controller generates appropriate interrupts to notify
changes in card-state.

Ok.

Yes, the first and the third works, but the second point needs a way
to identify the type of external card-detection mechanism.

This is as explained above. Maybe other controllers also need
something similar to "samsung,sdhci-cd-gpio" and "sdhci-cd-internal".
And so, we could make a generic binding for these as well.

Thanks,
Thomas.
