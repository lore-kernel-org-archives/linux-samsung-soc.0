Now this address is used at cpu boot, cpuidle, inform at this time.
As it touched at several places, it's defined at iodesc. if it changed
with ioremap, it has to export remaped address and each codes should
use it.

As I wrote at cover letter, if you want to use ioremap, it can be
modified. however can you merge firmware codes itself? since ioremap
is not related with trustzone  or firmware issues and it's exynos
specific implementation issues. Right?

Thank you,
