It's not correct.
At TRM, described as same voltage domain. But CD-pin is used with "always-on" power.
In circuit, CD# pin is disconnected.

Exynos series is using the external gpio-cd concept. So it need not to use MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL.
Can use the slot-gpio API. In my exynos5 board, it's working fine with the slot-gpio API.
