Thanks for pointing this out. I was not aware of  the implementor id
check requirement.

Regarding save/restore of these registers, I could send out a patch
cleaning these out once Shawn's patch gets merged. I'd need some help
testing it out on Exynos4 boards though. For now, is it OK if I just
update to the new function ?

I see that you have sent a patch out that ensures both part and
implementor number are checked. Currently, my patch has been applied
to the fixes branch of the arm-soc tree and I wanted to know how to
proceed (without it there is a crash on the 5420):
Should I request Arnd to drop it (if possible) and send out a new
patch using your updated function ?
