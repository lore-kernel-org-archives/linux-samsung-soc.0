Sorry, I have not had the time to re-check this and provide you with
the current temperature register value. I will definitely do so on
Monday and also provide you the dmesg output. I applied the following
patches on linux-next:

bbf872d thermal: exynos: Add TMU support for Exynos7 SoC
b8190ac dts: Documentation: Add documentation for Exynos7 SoC thermal bindings
9330ec1 thermal: exynos: Reorder exynos_map_dt_data() function
4dd41c4 thermal: exynos: dts: Provide device tree bindings identical
to the one in exynos_tmu_data.c
a7b80b9 thermal: dts: exynos: Trip points and sensor configuration
data for Exynos5440
77d072e thermal: exynos: dts: Define default thermal-zones for Exynos4
964dd36 thermal: dts: Default trip points definition for Exynos5420 SoCs
c1d2f97 thermal: exynos: dts: Add default definition of the TMU sensor parameter
02a4496 arm: dts: Adding CPU cooling binding for Exynos SoCs
bfadff0 arm: dts: odroid: Enable TMU at Exynos4412 based Odroid U3 device
862764c arm: dts: odroid: Add LDO10 regulator node necessary for TMU on Odroid
c064731 arm: dts: trats: Enable TMU on the Exynos4210 trats device

Along with the above list I have a patch which adds the dt changes
required for exynos7 on similar lines as done for exynos4/exynos5. In
the exyno7 trip point dts file I have modified the cpu-crit-0
temperature to a low value of 55C for testing purposes.

I would have expected the issue to show up on Exynos4/5 too. I will
test this on the 5420 based board I have on Monday.
