Ack. It could help fix some problems observed.

IIUC, this change is beacuse you move
mci_writel(host, CMD, cmd_flags | SDMMC_CMD_START) before
setting up the timer, so there is a timing gap that the cmd_done
already comes and handled by dw_mci_interrupt->dw_mci_cmd_interrupt.
At this point, we don't need the cto timer at all.

But why? If we still keep the original logic, it's always correct
that cmd_done comes after setting up the cto timer. So could you
eleborate a bit more to help me understand the real intention here?
