I have tested this patch on Origen board (Exynos4210 rev 1.1) and it
causes system lockup (it seems that the code gets stuck on waiting for
CPU1 to wake up).

The kernels I have tried:
* current -next + this patch + few fixes to bring it up to date
* commit cd245f5 + this patch + some fixes
* next-20140403 + your Exynos cpuidle patch series + this patch

I have also tried with S5P_VA_SYSRAM replaced by S5P_INFORM5 to
match Exynos 4210 rev 1.1 but it didn't help.

U-Boot version used is:
U-Boot 2012.07 (Sep 22 2012 - 05:12:41) for ORIGEN

Could you please tell me which hardware/bootloader/kernel exactly
have you used to test this patch?

Also could you please port/retest your patch over the current -next?

Best regards,
