Hrm.... it's so unlucky that your patchset comes a little late. As
your patch 8 and 9 said, you need them to fix problem for multi-card
support, so definitely there was no such use case, and even the code
was buggy to support it right? That makes the code hard to read and
maintain, so we decide to remove it.

Havn'e check the databook for details yet, but I think it's ok
to re-introduce multi-slot support if a real user benefits from
it. But you need a new patch to silent the log "num-slots property not
found, assuming 1 slot is available" as we removed all the num-slots
from DT at that time.
