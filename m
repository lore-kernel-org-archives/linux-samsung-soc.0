Oops, looks like there are a few points I failed to respond to here...


I'm not an expert on PCI -- I'm prepared to believe it works that way.

GICv3 can descriminate between different MSI senders based on ID
signals on the bus.

We are likely to get non-PCI MSIs in future SoC systems too, and there
are no standards governing how such systems should look.

Who knows?  A management component of the GPU that is under exclusive
control of the host or hypervisor might be wired up to bypass the IOMMU
completely.

I'm not saying this kind of thing definitely will happen, but I can't
say confidently that it won't.

Partly, yes.  The concept embodied by "dma-ranges" is correct, but the
topological relationship is not: the assumption that a master device
always masters onto its parent node doesn't work for non-tree-like
topologies.
