I was assuming that vendors would take the existing source code and
simply rebuild it to create the AArch64 secure world. As such, the same
SMC IDs, same structures, etc. would be used. The only source difference
would be to perhaps change some 32-bit registers/struct-fields up to
64-bit. Naively that sounds like the lowest-effort way to get an AArch64
secure world, so I'm purely guessing that that's what vendors will do.

I'm not sure of the implications of that statement. Since you mention
SMCs being handled by EL3, I think the quick-and-dirty conversion I
mention above is still likely to be used.
