I had an impression that last time you disliked such idea:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg338127.html
That's why I developed these patches. Because keeping a clock always on=
,
even when it is unused, is undesirable.

Anyway, I did some simple measurements (after booting Arndale Octa
to /bin/sh, idle):
 - with mau_epll gated: ~523 mA
 - with mau_epll always on: ~531 mA

Keeping it on increases energy usage by 1.5% in idle (with measurement
uncertainty ~0.4%).

There is Maudio power domain... but I think it is not related here.
Pinctrl driver does not have runtime PM and is not attached to a domain=
=2E
I thought about other solution to this problem (with utilization of
power domains):
 - add runtime PM to pinctrl and audss clocks,
 - attach pinctrl and audss clocks to maudio power domain,
 - enable the clock when power domain is turned on.
However almost the same changes had to be added to pinctrl and audss
clocks drivers (replace clock_enable() with pm_runtime_get_sync()).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
