Ajay, do you need this urgently or can we delay this one merge window? I don't
think that a week or so is enough to get a consistent API that gets everything
right. So if you have a pressing need to have it within the 3.2 kernel I'd
prefer to do it only for your driver now and adjust it when we get the thing
done, probably in 3.3.

I agree, scaling is an issue that should get solved on the way. So adding
u32 width, height;
with an initial/special value of 0 which means just take what the source
width/height is.

Did you have a look at the (existing) API [1] Laurent proposed for discovering
the internal connections between the framebuffers (or with any other devices)?
If you agree that it'd be a good idea to use it I feel that we should make the
windowing API more compatible with it. So basically what we want to have as a
window is one or more sunk pads so the pad-index should be also part of the
interface. I'm still confused with how OMAP works when it does not have a "root"
window/framebuffer. Normally I feel that the window position should be a
property of the parent window as this is what the position is relative too. But
if the parent is no framebuffer, should we also include the entity into the
interface to allow configuring things that are nor even framebuffers?
Also I think we need a z-index in case overlays overlap (might happen or?) and
enforcing that all z-indexes are different for the same entity.

As I see it xres/yres (together with xoffset/yoffset) is always the visible part
of the framebuffer. Typically that's also part of the timings as they define
what is visible. With the introduction of overlays (and maybe even for some
hardware anyway) it is no longer always true to have any timings at all. So on
all framebuffer that do not have physical timings the timing interpretation is
useless anyway (I'm thinking about adding a FB_CAP_NOTIMING) and what remains is
the interpretation of xres/yres as visible screen region.

I don't see it as adding new features, rather unifying what is already there for
easier use. Sure it should be done in a consistent way.
