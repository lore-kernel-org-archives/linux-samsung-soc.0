excuse my ignorance what are the crypto selftests you reference? Are they
run-time self tests run by crypto manager on algorithm registration?

I'm not quite convinced that a particular crypto accelerator driver
is the right place for this change, at least I don't see in the change
anything S5P-SSS specific, but it might be good to add the change.

Briefly looking at other drivers similarly atmel-* and omap-* have
slow path fallbacks, ./rockchip/rk3288_crypto_ablkcipher.c fails like
s5p-sss etc.

Anyway since it is a valid improvement, please feel free to add my
