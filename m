Ok, so what about a compromise which I think would work for "both" HWs 
... we allow the "configure" operation during video on, then each HW 
driver could decide if this means you have to stop or not to do the 
changes required. But then it is also important that we keep all config 
in one struct and not split it up. Otherwise HW like ours that has so be 
stopped could need to stop once for each setting/operation called.
So in short, allow configure(bus_params) during video on, keep all 
bus_params in the struct. It is in kernel struct so it can easily be 
changed/refactored.

Again, this probing and bus muxing is platform/bus specific and not 
panel specific. Any panel of that type will only ever work on Omap (or 
someone else implementing the same muxing features) as I see it. So why 
not just put that config on the bus master, dispc? I still can't see how 
this is panel config. You are only pushing CDF API and meta data to 
describe something that is only needed by one bus master. I have never 
seen any DSI slave that can change their pin config. And since there is 
no generic hot plug detect of DSI panels, at least not before DSI bus is 
available, I have to assume this probing it very platform specific. We 
have some products that provide 1-2 gpios to specify what panel is 
available, some use I2C sensor probing to then assume the panel plugged.
At least in the first step I don't think this type of hot plug should be 
in the API. Then once the base panel driver is in we could discuss 
different solutions for you hot plug scenario.
