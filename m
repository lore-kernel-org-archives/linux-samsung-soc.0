Well, all I know is what the original commit descriptions says and
that the commit itself comes from patchset adding Exynos7 USB 3.0
support [1]:

commit 72d996fc7a01c2e4d581a15db7d001e2799ffb29
Author: Vivek Gautam <gautam.vivek@samsung.com>

    usb: dwc3: exynos: Add provision for suspend clock
    
    DWC3 controller on Exynos SoC series have separate control for
    suspend clock which replaces pipe3_rx_pclk as clock source to
    a small part of DWC3 core that operates when SS PHY is in its
    lowest power state (P3) in states SS.disabled and U3.

Anton's & Vivek's Samsung email addresses are no longer valid but
I added current Vivek's email address to Cc:.

BTW What is interesting is that the Exynos7 dts patch [2] has never
made it into upstream for some reason.  In the meantime however
Exynos5433 (similar to Exynos7 to some degree) became the user of
susp_clk.
