Yes, please cc me and also to Sjoerd since we are working on machines
that have Atmel maxtouch chips.

Awesome, what do you think about the change to have a common input device
initialization function that I squashed in your original patch?
mxt_initialize_t100_input_device() and mxt_initialize_t9_input_device()
are very similar so I think that is a sensible refactoring as well.

If you agree with the change I can post it on top of your patch once it
lands in mainline.

Best regards,
Javier
