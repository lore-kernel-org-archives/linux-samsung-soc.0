Are you seeing this on Chromebook2 (Peach-Pi 5800) too ?

The 3 boards I have access to (SMDK5420, Chromebook Peach-Pi and
Chromebook Peach-Pit) work fine with MCPM enabled. I am not sure why
it is failing only on the above mentioned boards as there is nothing
specific to them in the MCPM back-end.

I assume that when you default to platsmp (on disabling MCPM), the
non-working boards boot all cores upto userspace without any issues ?

Based on the timeline (problems started about 2.5 months back), there
have only been a couple of changes in the 5420 MCPM back-end. Could
you revert the following commits and check if things improve.

20fe6f9 ARM: EXYNOS: Support cluster power off on exynos5420/5800
fbb0499 ARM: 8083/1: exynos: activate the CCI on boot CPU/cluster
using the MCPM loopback

These might not revert cleanly, so instead of the above you could also
comment the following 2 lines:

If you still get aborts then I suspect that the problem is with the
bootloader configuration but am not sure. I am OK with disabling
5420_MCPM in the default configuration in such a case. This would
however mean that S2R also stops working by default on 5420.
