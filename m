Basically the requirement is mandated by exynos7 manual. It tells that
before turning off the power domain, some clock registers need to saved
and should be restored just after turning the power domain. These clock
registers are not necessarily gate clocks but could be mux clocks etc.
The driver may not have all information of these clocks also. I suppose
these are Soc specific changes but drivers should work across Socs.
This behavior is almost similar to suspend/resume case where a whole
list of clock registers are saved/restored.

Even earlier post by Sylwester (https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/5/182) also points
to the need of this feature.

Yes right the global notifier block can be moved to per genpd structure.
Also SoC trigger can be moved to core files.

I also thought about same. But the trigger point for this would be
driver calling
clk disable/enable and not the power domain. so this will lead to lot of
save/restore for each power domain child.

right :( may be I should have posted this as RFC
Thanks for the review.
