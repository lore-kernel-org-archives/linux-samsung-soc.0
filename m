We were using a similar approach with USB PHY layer but things started 
breaking after the device names are created using PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO. 
Now theres no way to reliably know the device names in advance.
Btw I had such device name binding in my v3 of this patch series [1] and 
had some discussion with Grant during that time [2].
