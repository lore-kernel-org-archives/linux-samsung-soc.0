I've missed the fix, sorry.

BTW, as you know, all of exynos SoCs are based on SMP so generally (in
normal case) there is no reason to use non-SMP on exynos
platforms...even though I understand the build error should be fixed...

Anyway, I'll have a look Bart's patch and Russell's fix in this weekend.

Thanks for your kindly pointing out.
