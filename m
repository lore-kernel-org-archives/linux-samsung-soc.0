Thank you in advance.

In general it simplifies navigation through the list of headers for
humans IMHO.

By example, let's look at drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dw2102.c :

#include "dw2102.h"
#include "si21xx.h"
#include "stv0299.h"
#include "z0194a.h"
#include "stv0288.h"
#include "stb6000.h"
#include "eds1547.h"
#include "cx24116.h"
#include "tda1002x.h"
#include "mt312.h"
#include "zl10039.h"
#include "ts2020.h"
#include "ds3000.h"
#include "stv0900.h"
#include "stv6110.h"
#include "stb6100.h"
#include "stb6100_proc.h"
#include "m88rs2000.h"
#include "tda18271.h"
#include "cxd2820r.h"
#include "m88ds3103.h"
#include "ts2020.h"

Was it obvious for an author/reviewers that commit 0fecb6c0944f adds a
duplicate?

What is the chance to add a duplicate, if the list of headers is sorted?

Good, thank you for checking it :)
