If you referred to SM-N910C released kernel, I agree.

As you described, 393216003 might be more correct than 393216000,
IMHO, I think that TRM specified 393216000 instead of 393216003,
because the following equation is clean without any decimal point.
- "393216000 / 8192 = 48000"

I have no any objection, if 393216003 is correct result.

Could you share your equation?
because your result is a little bit different of my result.
- my equation : ((mdiv + kdiv/65535) x 24MHz) / (pdiv x POWER(2,sdiv))
