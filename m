One of the reasons for keeping the supported frequencies independent
of the cpufreq table was ensure that platforms are free to use only a
subset of the supported clock speed due to certain performance/power
requirements particular to that platform Two or more platforms based
on the same SoC can have different power/performance requirements. The
case of thermal is different, it can only request for the CPU to be
clocked at speeds supported by the cpufreq driver.

Also, the core clock type is not limited to be used only by the
cpufreq driver. It should be possible to use a platform without the
cpufreq driver but still have the flexibility to change the cpu clock
speed.

Yes, I agree with you. The ->set_rate() callback code is not going to
be repeated if the code can be reused for other Exynos SoCs.

And about the values of the registers for set_rate coming in from DT,
these are SoC specific values and are not different for two or more
platforms using the same SoC. So why put this into DT? The same was
the argument about populating all the clocks from DT. Clock blocks are
not going to change from one platform to another platform which use
the same SoC. They are SoC specific and not platform specific and
hence there is little use in putting them into DT.
