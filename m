Not sure what happened here, but my and Tomasz's Tested-by were given 
for v5 of the patch series including 6e6aac7590, while it seems v6 
has been applied. And the patch is not same in both series.

There could be some differences in the base tree I used when testing 
this [1] series, as it was hard to determine against what tag it was 
created exactly. Also I didn't test in on all platforms, only 
Exynos4412.

And the cpufreq really needs to get fixed, as it now modifies registers
which belong to the clock driver...
