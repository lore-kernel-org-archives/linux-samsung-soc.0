CPUFREQ use the cpu utilization data to decide the current state of CPU
by CPUFREQ governor. 

Exynos busfreq with DEVFREQ must need the data to monitor the current state
of memory bus of Exynos SoC. So, the devfreq-events provide the current state
of memory bus like as cpu utilization. Exynos busfreq could decide the state
of memory bus by using the devfreq-events.

The summary of devfreq-event device is as following: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/7/795)
: This patch add new devfreq_event class for devfreq_event device which provide
raw data (e.g., memory bus utilization/GPU utilization). This raw data from
devfreq_event data would be used for the governor of devfreq subsystem.
- devfreq_event device : Provide raw data for governor of existing devfreq device
- devfreq device       : Monitor device state and change frequency/voltage of device
                         using the raw data from devfreq_event device

Because the memory bus node in this patch was dependent on only Exynos SoC.
I didn't check the memory bus of another SoC except for Exynos SoC.

First of all, I explain the meaning of 'memory bus group' and 'memory bus block'.
- The 'memory bus group' includes various memory bus group and has one regulatot for power.
Also, it must need the devfreq-events device to monitor the current state of memory buses.
- The 'memory bus block' has only one clock for memory bus and different clock rate.
And the memory bus blocks which are included in same 'memory bus group' use the same power rail (regulator).

This patch adds 'frequency' table for each memory bus block because
each memory bus block has different clock rate. Only one operating-point table
cannot support various memory bus blocks.

So, I added the frequency table to each memory bus block.

I explain the hierarchy of Exynos memory buses.

This patch divide the memory bus group according to power rail (regulator).
- MIF (Memory Interface ) memory bus group uses the VDD_MIF regulator.
- INT (Internal) memory bus group uses the VDD_INT regulator.

For example,.
Each memory bus group contains only one power rail(regulator) and one more memory bus blocks as follwing:

- MIF memory bus group                     
power rail(VDD_MIF)-->|--- memory bus for DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) block (dmc clock)


- INT memory bus group
                      |--- memory bus for PERI block (aclk_100 clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for DISPLAY block (aclk_160 clock)
                      |  
                      |--- memory bus for ISP block (aclk_200 clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for GPS block (aclk_266 clock)
power rail(VDD_INT)-->|
                      |--- memory bus for MCUISP block (aclk_400_mcuisp clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for Leftbus block (gdl clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for Rightbus block (gdr clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for MFC block (mfc clock)

I'm not sure that the memory bus concept of this patch
would support the memory bus of all SoCs. So, I didn't modify common bus driver.

If I misunderstand about your question, please explain in more detail about your opinion.

I explained the 'frequency' table of each memory bus block on upper reply.
