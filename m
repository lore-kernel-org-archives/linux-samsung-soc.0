I've updated the patch to reflect the requested changes. See below for 
the few contentious points:

This seems to be the expected construct to override a parent interrupt 
controller. Actually, this is already what happens when you have a 
single interrupt-controller and a global interrupt-parent property.

The per-cpu timers are using PPIs.  As such,. they are not routed 
through the LIC, but are wired to the GIC instead.

The Tegra timer is using SPI (and can probably be used as a wake-up 
source). As such, it is connected to the LIC, not to the GIC.

Per-CPU timers (arch timer for A15 and TWD for A9) are all using PPIs, 
and are directly wired to the GIC.

Which, in my understanding, is the right thing to do. Unless I missed 
something obvious about this?

Thanks,
