Hi Andrew,

Yes you are right that this patches first came into your tree and then
Len applied into his next tree for 3.5 merge. so they got into
linux-next tree. After some last minute pull issues they could not be
merged in 3.5 and Len dropped this series from his -next branch. I
hope to get it accepted in 3.6 merge.
I am aware that some work is going on for thermal framework
improvement but that will have minimal changes on cpufreq cooling APIs
and I hope to fix them as bug fix patches.

Its my fault that I didn't check the hwmon-next branch. I will repost
them after merging with hwmon-next branch.

Thanks,
