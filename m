OK. I'll modify it on next patchiest.

I add the detailed description on patch9 which is included in this
patch-set as follwoing.
- [RFC PATCH 09/15] PM / devfreq: exynos: Update documentation for bus
devices usingpassive governor

This patch-set don' include the the list of children node in parent dt node.
Instead, I add the separate node and then each children node has the
the phandle of parent node

DMC (DRAM Memory Controller) bus need to gather the current load in
bus on runtime.
The Exynos SoC has the PPMU (Platform Performance Monitoring Unit) for
sub-blocks.
The "ppmu_dmc0_3" and "ppmu_dmc1_3" measure the current load in DMC bus
with DEVFREQ-EVENT framework.

So, "bus_dmc" uses the load result from "ppmu_dmc0_3" and
"ppmu_dmc1_3" when deciding
the next bus frequency as basis data of dmc bus.
