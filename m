The device tree source files are independent of any OS specific
implementations. The linux driver for this controller uses dw-mmc and
dw_mci but drivers of this controller for other operating systems
could choose use other names. Since Synopsis calls this controller as
mshc, the dts file would be closer to hardware specs if 'mshc' is used
to describe the controller.

If the existing driver requires any Exynos4 specific extensions to
operate the controller correctly on Exynos4, then yes we should add a
Exynos4 type. The Exynos4 and Exynos5 implementations of this
controller vary in certain aspects and so we might need a Exynos4 type
as well.
