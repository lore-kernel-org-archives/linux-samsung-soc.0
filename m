We had a long discussion about this when we introduced the drivers/soc
framework. The intention is that the /sys/devices/soc* node is meant to
describe the SoC in its entirety, the same way you have a pci0000:00 node
as the root of all PCI devices of the first pci host bridge on a PC
system. This also reflects the reality of a SoC, which normally has one
bus that the CPU is connected to and that has all the other devices as
children.

Having the chipid registers as part of the top-level bus should not
be interpreted as having the other devices as children of the chipid
device, but rather the chipid registers as a property of the soc itself
as opposed to a random device that happens to be part of the soc.
