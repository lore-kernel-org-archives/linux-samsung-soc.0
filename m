Hello Lee,

This series contains some improvements for the Device Tree bindings of
the Maxim MAX77686 and MAX77802 multi-function devices.

This is the second version of the series that addresses issues pointed
out by Krzysztof Kozlowski and Sergei Shtylyov.

Patch #1 changes the max77686 binding to not suggest using a deprecated
property of the regulator DT binding.

Patch #2 changes the max77686 example to use a generic node name instead
of the chip's name.

Patch #3 adds a DT binding for the mfd portion of the max77802 that was
missing.

Patch #4 moves the regulator portion of the max77686 to the regulator's
DT binding sub-directory since it is a better fit for this information.
This fourth patch needs an ack from the regulator sub-system maintainer.

Changes in v2:
- Add Krzysztof Kozlowski Reviewed-by tag in patch #1.
- Use the correct "maxim,max77802" compatible string.
  Suggested by Krzysztof Kozlowski
- Use a pmic generic node name for the max77802 node example.
  Suggested by Sergei Shtylyov.
- Use a generic name for the max77686 node in the regulator example.

Javier Martinez Canillas (4):
  mfd: max77686: Don't suggest in binding to use a deprecated property
  mfd: max77686: Use a generic name for the PMIC node in the example
  mfd: Add DT binding for Maxim MAX77802 IC
  mfd: max77686: Split out regulator part from the DT binding
