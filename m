Yes, I did mention this and it is an option to either replace the patch
now or to do at a later date to tidy things up. I'm not going to reject
this patch now (or force a rewrite at this late stage)

I'll try and look at acking the last set of SDHCI patches Thomas sent
and see if akpm will pick them up for linux-mmc.

Yes, I was feeling that this is something that we should probably discuss
either on linux-arm-kernel or to a wide audience. It might not suit
everyone's taste, etc.
