I don't think that such micro-optimization makes sense in this case.
Please note that there is still no platform and driver which require
this deferred probe logic - in my case exynos power domain driver is
registered very early, so dev_pm_domain_attach() calls succeeds in the
standard amba device registration path. This patch is mainly to get
the device registered to power domain to properly read its cid/pid
pair.
