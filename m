Physical-vs-logical probably means different things to different people.
What I mean is that DT should represent the HW modules at the
granularity that the HW documentation or designers describe the HW.

a) Linux has absolutely nothing to do with this. Again, DT is purely a
HW description that should not be influenced by OS limitations.

b) Linux does have to deal with this. HW exists which uses multiple
power domains per DT device node.

The fact that Linux forces the driver internals to create a separate
struct device for each part of the actual device that's in a different
power domain should not force us into representing the HW incorrectly in DT.

In my opinion, for all new resource bindings, we need to *exclusively*
support named-based lookup. That's the only way to ensure a simple
forward-compatible path to extensible DT bindings in the face of
multiple instances of a certain type of resource, where some are
optional. If resource lookups start out by index, and then later
(missing information when the DT binding was written, extending the DT
binding to a new HW revision/model) we find we need to add more
instances of that resource, some of which are optional, then anything
but purely name-based lookup makes the situation very complex.

We should solve this by simply using named-based lookup from the start
in all cases. That's my point here. Hence, we need to addm and enforce
usage of, a power-domain-names property.
