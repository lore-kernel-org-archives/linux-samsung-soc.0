CC'ed Thomas Abraham, Vivek Gautam

I think so.

I looked at Arndale board Schematics.
'Hub chip' on Arndale board needs hub reset/enable code.
'HUB_RESET' and 'HUB_CONNECT' pins are used to reset 'Hub chip'
on Arndale board, not Exynos EHCI controller. So, Exynos EHCI driver
does not need to consider this hub reset/enable code.

If there is a driver for this 'Hub chip', 'Hub chip' driver maybe
consider this.

However, Olof Johansson mentioned, 'drivers/platform/arm/board_arndale.c'
would be a good alternative.

It looks good.
