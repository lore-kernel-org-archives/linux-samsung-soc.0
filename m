Oh I see. In that case, I guess just having "width" properties is fine,
and I can see how it's much more likely this scheme would be extensible
to any future SoC that sticks with the same overall kind of register
structure.

It'd be a good idea to describe this explicitly in the binding
documentation.

BTW, how does the driver know what register addresses to use; I can see
the base for each pin controller bank is in samsung,pctl-offset, but
what describes the offset for each of the func, pud, drv, ... registers
from there? Are the offsets the same for all current Samsung SoCs?
