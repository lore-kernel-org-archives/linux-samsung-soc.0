Right.

I don't understand. An MSI controller is just an address that acts
as a DMA slave for a 4-byte inbound data packet. It has no way of
knowing who is sending data, other than by the address or the data
sent to it. Are you talking of something else?

A lot of SoCs have MSI integrated into the PCI root complex, which
of course is pointless from MSI perspective, as well as implying that
the MSI won't go through the IOMMU.

We have briefly mentioned MSI in the review of the Samsung GH7 PCI
support. It's possible that this one can either use the built-in
MSI or the one in the GICv2m.

Wouldn't they just have IOMMUs with multiple contexts?

It would be 'dma-ranges'. Unfortunately that would imply that each DMA
master is connected to only one IOMMU, which you say is not necessarily
the case. The simpler case of a device is only a master on a single IOMMU
but can use multiple contexts would however work fine with dma-ranges.
