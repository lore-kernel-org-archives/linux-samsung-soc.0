Hello Chanwoo,

sorry for the late reply. I was staying with my parents over the
Christmas days and didn't have access to the board. Also internet
connectivity was a bit troublesome *rolleyes*

I've spend some time to go through the regmap core and the regmap mmio
code, and I don't see the point in this conversion.

What you do is to replace __raw_{readl,writel}() with writel()/readl(),
which is what regmap mmio calls internally. So in particular this adds
memory barriers. Plus all the indirection, spinlock locking/unlocking, etc.

See below for a detailed analysis of regmap_write().

You want to have some error code returned just for the sake of having an
error code. I don't follow this reasoning. In particular if it involves
putting a indirection layer on top, without gaining anything from it.

The conversion doesn't make the code cleaner, which can be already seen
from the diffstat (much more lines added than removes). It also doesn't
make the code safer.

No offense meant by 'dubious', but it is indeed the case here. :)

No, it's not clear to me.

Please see the regmap core code yourself, and ask yourself what kind of
errors you're actually checking here.

Take e.g. regmap_write() and trace the return statements.
- alignment check [in regmap_write]
  We already know that we always have correct alignment.
- writable check [in _regmap_write]
  We already know that the code only writes to writable registers.
- clock checks [in regmap_mmio_write]
  We don't do clock management via regmap.

If you look at regmap_mmio_write() again, you see that no error value is
propagated from ctx->reg_write(ctx, reg, val) at all. If you omit the
clock stuff, then regmap_mmio_write() always returns zero.

Hence we have replaced a simple __raw_writel(), a function that maps to
a single (!) CPU instruction on ARM, with a bunch of checks that are
known (by static analysis) to never fail, plus the write instruction
with memory barriers.
And we do all this _every_ _single_ _time_. For a particular bad example
see the zero-initialisation in exynos_ppmu_v2_disable(). Sorry, but by
all means, this is not a improvement of the code.

My preliminary tests show a increase of CPU cycles spend to access these
registers by several orders of magnitude. Not surprising, with the
memory barriers and the spinlocks now in place.

Maybe I have some time on the weekend to do some further tests.

> Do you mean that regmap-mmio is unneeded?
I'm saying that in _this_ particular case, the use of regmap-mmio is
counterproductive.

Sure, you could probably add six more abstraction layers on top and the
system would still be fast enough to handle ut, but I don't see why you
want to make code slower on _purpose_, just for the sake of using
regmap-mmio.

regmap-mmio has its purpose, but I disagree that it applies here (both
for exynos-bus and ppmu). The diffstat again supports my point.

This is no improvement.

First of all the amount of init code in exynos_ppmu_parse_dt() has
increased with your patch. Instead of of_iomap()  you now have
platform_get_resource(), devm_ioremap_resource() and
devm_regmap_init_mmio() there.
If iounmap() really were a problem, which I doubt it is, one could just
use devm_ioremap().

The writable/readable argument is also none, since you have to supply
this information yourself/explicitly. We know beforehand which registers
are of which type. This is not a situation where e.g. userspace passes
us some values, which might potentially be wrong. We know when a
register is writable and when it's not. Everything else would a bug in
the code itself.
