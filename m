Hmm. I tend to think this is exactly the opposite of the correct
direction; you end up wasting a whole ton of time during the boot
process parsing data out of the device tree only to end up with exactly
the same tables that you would have just put into the kernel anyway. Is
it really likely that future SoCs will change information such as the
width of the pullup/pulldown bitfield, but not change anything else
that's not already in this binding. If that isn't the case, the binding
won't be complete enough to describe any new features on future SoCs anyway.

I don't think those two are correlated; the GPIO specifier format could
just as easily be <bank pin> irrespective of whether the pinctrl driver
contains SoC-specific tables or not.

That's unfortunate; it would be the most interesting part to review. I
guess I'll try to work out the binding from the examples in patch 6.
