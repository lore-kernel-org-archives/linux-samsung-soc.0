I would beg you to please spend some time understanding what exactly I =

More so because I am not very good at communicating.

In short, a simple ALSA ring buffer ?

Of course. And I am not complaining about those s/w reported underruns/=
overruns.
BTW, instead of 7/8 we could also set the threshold in ALSA drivers to
require apps
to fill it 8/8 before triggering and that would keep the buffer filled
to the brim.

There is difference as explained below.

I am afraid not so. Ex, PL080 provides LLI mechanism using which can ha=
ve
true circular buffer behaviour and yet get updates/irqs from the PL080.

Let me try to elaborate the difference ...

* In h/w supported Linked-List-Item(LLI), the DMA finishes one
transfer, triggers an irq and then continues with
transferring the next linked transfer item.
 Please note the dma is active and peripheral fifos always keep
receiving/providing data while cpu services the irq.  H/w like PL080
provides this LLI mechanism readily.

* In s/w emulated LLI (DMA API driver maintaining circularly linked
transfer requests)  the dma finishes one
programmed transfer, triggers an irq and _stop_ transferring data,
the cpu then program the DMA with next item in the list and triggers
the DMA operation.
 Please note, the peripheral fifos don't get any data after dma
transfer completes and before cpu program and trigger the dma again.
In this case, a 'fast peripheral with shallow fifo' might run out of
data before the next DMA transfer begins. And some IPs consider the
state as erroneous.
In real life, I saw that with the Samsung's SPDIF controller which has
fifo depth only for a few samples and it gets very demanding if pro
quality is expected. Aggravate that with high irq-latency under system
load.
And in such cases, it is much more preferable to employ system timers
to generate period_elapsed updates and queue the whole ring buffer as
one transfer item to be iterated endlessly by dma. Ex, PL330 doesn't
lend to LLI but can be programmed endlessly looping one transfer item.

In short, I am talking about FIFO underruns/overruns _between_ two DMA
transfers.
I am not talking about ring buffer overruns/underruns.

Thanks,
Jassi
