Here's what we have on OMAP:

We have a bunch of hardware overlays, each of which can go to one
output. When using fbdev, the pixel data for overlays comes from the
framebuffers. One fb can be used as a  pixel source for multiple
overlays.

So, for example, the "connections" can be like these:

           Initial configuration

 .-----.         .------.           .------.
 | fb0 |-------->| ovl0 |-----.---->| LCD  |
 '-----'         '------'     |     '------'
 .-----.         .------.     |
 | fb1 |-------->| ovl1 |-----|
 '-----'         '------'     |
 .-----.         .------.     |     .------.
 | fb2 |-------->| ovl2 |-----'     |  TV  |
 '-----'         '------'           '------'


      Video on fb1, shown on LCD and TV

 .-----.         .------.           .------.
 | fb0 |-------->| ovl0 |-----.---->| LCD  |
 '-----'         '------'     |     '------'
 .-----.         .------.     |
 | fb1 |----.--->| ovl1 |-----'
 '-----'    |    '------'
 .-----.    |    .------.           .------.
 | fb2 |    '--->| ovl2 |---------->|  TV  |
 '-----'         '------'           '------'


And how the actual image is composited on the display, we have first the
fb side (no news there):

 |           |                          |           |
 |           '--------------------------'           |
 |                                                  |

 '--------------------------------------------------'

The area marked by x/yoffset and x/yres is used as the pixel source for
the overlay.

On the display we have something like this:

 .----------------disp-xres----------------.
 |                                         |
 | (xpos,ypos)                             |
 |      .-----ovl-xres-----.               |
 d      |                  |               |
 i      o                  |               |
 s      v                  |               |
 p      l                  |               |
 |      |                  |               |
 y      y                  |               |
 r      r                  |               |
 e      e                  |               |
 s      s                  |               |
 |      |                  |               |
 |      '------------------'               |
 |                                         |
 '-----------------------------------------'

The x/ypos of the overlay does not have any relation to the x/yoffset of
the framebuffer. The overlay's x/yres is the same as the fb's x/yres in
case the overlay doesn't support scaling (OMAP's case this is true for
overlay0). Otherwise the overlay's x/yres is only limited by the HW's
scaling capabilities.

The overlays have a priority order, and where there's no overlay, a
background color is used. So like this:

 .-----------------------------------------.
 |            background color             |
 | .-----------------------.               |
 | |         ovl0          |               |
 | |                       |               |
 | | .--------------.      |               |
 | | |     ovl1     |      |               |
 | | |              |      |               |
 | | |        .-------------------.        |
 | | |        |       ovl2        |        |
 | | '--------|                   |        |
 | '----------|                   |        |
 |            |                   |        |
 |            |                   |        |
 |            |                   |        |
 |            '-------------------'        |
 '-----------------------------------------'

As you may have noticed, this raises in annoying problem: the
framebuffer does not represent the display, and thus the display related
information in the fb, like video timings, are difficult or impossible
to use. I haven't found any solution to this.

Right, and there may not be a root screen at all, like on OMAP. (if the
background color doesn't count as a root screen).

We already have the current implementation in omapfb, so while a
standard API would be nice, we still need to keep the old custom API for
compatibility.

Another thing is that I'm not sure how much features we should try to
add to fbdev. The fbdev model is a bit limited (for example, the timings
problem above, or double/triple buffering), and at least we are
currently looking at using DRM. There will still be a framebuffer, but
that's mostly for fbconsole and such, and doesn't need to support
overlays, scaling, and other more complex features.
