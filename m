First, we used to do that and we switched over to what we have right
now several years ago, because it didn't work reliably then.

Arguably, CPU hotplug is in a much better shape now, so it might be
working better, but that would be a huge change and lots of
documentation would need to be revised. :-)

Also it is not true that everything is done on a single CPU, but I'm
not really sure about the possible slowdown.

Second, there are (many) systems for which that change is not really
necessary and it is risky because of possible regressions.

I guess that CPUs depending on I2C for online/offline could be taken
offline earlier and brought back online later during suspend/resume,
like before/after the _noirq suspend of devices, but doing that on all
systems altogether is almost guaranteed to introduce regressions.
