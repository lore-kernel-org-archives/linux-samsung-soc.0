I will split them to SoC and Board DT patches.

There is no combiner in 5260. Each GPX bank is connected one GIC interrupt
line.

I moved this node to Board file. I hope that is correct.

Ok. I will remove "gpc0-3" from sdX_bus4.

I will remove them. These are optional properties which are not being referred

I will reorder the patches to ensure build doesn't break.

It is quite different than other Exynos5 SoCs specially the physical
address of the
IPs.
