This patch adds support SDMMC write protection pin on SMDKV210.

Changes since v2:
Addressed comments from Marek Szyprowski

- modified wp_gpio checking method for support gpio number 0.
- removed unnecessary checking in dev-hsmmc.c

Changes since v1:
Addressed comments from Ben Dooks, Maurus Cuelenaere and Kyungmin Park

- just pass gpio numbers for support WP as Ben's suggestion
- use the gpio layer for specific machine
- use s3c_sdhcix_set_platdata() in machine_init()
- removed unnecessary EXPORT_SYMBOL

Note: Depends on following patch set

[PATCH v2 1/2] ARM: SAMSUNG: Add device definition for HSMMC3
[PATCH v2 2/2] ARM: S5PV210: Add support HSMMC on SMDKV210
[PATCH v4] Samsung: add new card detection methods in s3c-sdhci driver (platform part) from Marek Szyprowski 
[PATCH v4] sdhci-s3c: add support for new card detection methods (driver part) from Marek Szyprowski 

And this patch set includes the following patches:

[PATCH v3 1/2] ARM: SAMSUNG: Add the member of platdata to implement SDMMC Write Protection
[PATCH v3 2/2] ARM: S5PV210: Add support SDMMC WP through EXT_INT on SMDKV210
[PATCH v3 3/3] sdhci-s3c: Add SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_WP_BIT quirk for Samsung SoC
