Hi Chris,

The assumption here was that the all the binding documentation have to
be generic enough to be useful for non-linux platforms as well. And
there were previous discussions on actually moving the binding
documentation outside of the linux source and maintained separately.

Hence, the text file states that it describes the bindings used by
Samsung's SDHCI controller. If you prefer, I can resubmit this patch
with samsung,sdhci-s3c.txt as the file name for the bindings
documentation file.

Thanks,
Thomas.
