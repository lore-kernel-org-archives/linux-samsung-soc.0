Or a fix could be queued on top of this. Since (I believe) this series
has been queued for 3.19, we have 6 or 7 RC releases ahead, which
could be used for the purpose of fixing things (as they are supposed
to?).

I'm afraid we need more than that.

First of all, this series has been in the wild for more than 3 months
already, without any serious changes. Need not to mention that mailing
lists and maintainers of all potentially affected platforms had been
added. It had been noted in cover letter that the only platform I (and
Marek later) could test on was Exynos and that it would be good if
somebody working with other platforms could test the patches.

Looks like nobody cared back then, so why should we care that much
now, especially that we have several RC releases ahead and we can
still fix this?

Best regards,
Tomasz
