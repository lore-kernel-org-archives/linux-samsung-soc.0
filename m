Marek, this is great work! It's been on my TODO list forever, so I
really appreciate your work here.

I did only a brief review so far, particularly concentrating on the
changes for device links and runtime PM. I like it!

Perhaps we can get someone like Arnd/Vinod to comment in general idea
from a DT and DMA slave channel point of view. I don't know that stuff
good enough to give good opinion.

A couple of things that crosses my mind so far:
1) I have planned to extend pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() to cover
also device links. Seems like that becomes really useful together with
these changes.
2) I think there will be some corner cases during system
suspend/resume for pl330. Not sure yet though. However, fixing 1) and
converting the driver to use pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume() should
probably work anyway.

Allow me to help out looking into 1) and 2). If not for pl330, I am
pretty sure it will be useful for other DMA controllers that
implements device links and runtime PM.

[...]

Kind regards
Uffe
