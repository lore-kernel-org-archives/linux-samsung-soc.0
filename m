Agreed, but it is odd for those registers not to be banked in hardware. Marc
and I spoke to some of the hardware chaps at ARM and they don't see this as
a common setup in the future, so rather than litter the GIC driver with
__percpu variables, we might be better off adding some extra platform callbacks
to the set that we already have.
