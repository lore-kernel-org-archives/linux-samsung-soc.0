Right.  I was proposing doing something similar to his, but for the
separate "sysreg" address range.  ...then adding a clock to the
generic syscon driver.

I _think_ the syscon clock doesn't really need to be always on--it
only needs to be on during the access of these registers, right?  I
make this statement based on the fact that exynos5250 boards currently
bootup and are very functional, but this clock is currently off.

Right, we're using #2 for this now, but one problem is that it's
possible that the firmware may turn off one of these misc-type clocks.
 On exynos5250-snow we ran into this.  The firmware actually gates the
clock needed for accessing the chip_id, though perhaps that's not one
of the clocks that needs to be on all the time.
