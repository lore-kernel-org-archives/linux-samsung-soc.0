I tried the approach of listing the optimal frequencies of these
clocks in dt and then calculating a divider value. But it turns out
that the divider values for these clocks is dependent on the frequency
of the PLL from which they are derived (or the voltage applied to the
CPU clock domain). During tests, the system is unstable if divider
values are calculated using the optimal clock speed listed in the SoC
manual.

So the list of divider values as used in this series (and documented
above) is required. Can I continue to use the binding as documented
above?

Thanks,
Thomas.
