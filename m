Good question is always a helpful advice. I don't have such hardware
details and I've did my patches basing on what I've observed while
playing with the hardware.

I've checked again and I found that the only things that need to be
done to get ARM arch timer working are:

1. enable multi core timer clock,
2. set MCT_G_TCON_START (Timer enable) bit in MCT_G_TCON (Global timer
control) register.

Otherwise arch timer doesn't get any tick.

Changing CPUHP priorities nor any other MCT register writes are not
needed. It looks that they were leftovers from my older approaches
and I've kept them without really checking if they are needed in the
final version.

I will send a new simplified version of this patchset then.

My summary above suggests that ARM architected timers are fed from the
physical counter, which is controlled by MCT registers.
