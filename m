These patches were taken from the ChromeOS 3.8 kernel so I don't really know
why these values were chosen. I'll let Andrew or one of the ChromiumOS folks
to answer this question.

Ok.

For the first question, no. ret is always -EAGAIN when result is
EC_RES_IN_PROGRESS.

All the cros_ec transport drivers (cros_ec_{i2c,spi,lpc}) have the following
code block:

	switch (msg->result) {
	...
	case EC_RES_IN_PROGRESS:
		ret = -EAGAIN;
	...
	};

For the second question, yes AFAICT. Some transports transfer function return
-EAGAIN and that error is propagated. As an example i2c_transfer() returns
-EAGAIN if the struct i2c_adapter bus_lock mutex is tried to be acquired.

But after looking at all the cros_ec transport drivers it seems to be safe to
just check if result is EC_RES_IN_PROGRESS instead of checking also if ret is
-EAGAIN since (at least on all the current transport drivers) the former
implies the later.

Ok.

When ret > 0, it means the actual amount of data received in the transfer.
