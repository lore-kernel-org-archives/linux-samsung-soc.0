Oops :-( 

Mr. Jang and Mr. Lee didn't know that there was submitted driver which is
for Synopsys DesignWare MMC controller. Of course me too.
Actually, they surveyed when needed implementation that, but couldn't find
any driver for it at that time...

Anyway, Will's dw_mmc can replace this so we can drop this and we'll adopt
and test it on our platform.

Thanks and Happy New year!

Best regards,
Kgene.
