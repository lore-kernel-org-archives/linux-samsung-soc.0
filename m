Now that the PL330 code is entirely out of arch/arm, the header should no
longer be in asm/hardware/pl330.h.

Definitions private to the driver should be in drivers/dma/pl330.c or a
header file co-located.  Other definitions for interfaces to that driver
(eg, platform data) should be in include/linux/amba.

That can be the subject of a follow-up patch if this is already finalized.
