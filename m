The iROM will check the GPIO pin to select which core is run as cpu0.
I think no one will change the GPIO pin if a new board which is based
on exynos5422 :)

In this situation, all exynos5422 boards(odroid xu3 series and mobile
phone) have same cpu configurations. If we move the exynos5420 cpu
configuration from exynos5420.dtsi, we should change all dts which
including exynos5420.dtsi.
I think we'd better to defer the change until a new exynos5422 board
which has different cpu configurations is added.
