It seems that exynos5260/5420 mixers also have same limitation: SX/Y
fields is 11 bits.

>=20

So I guess that the reason Mixer controller was operated incorrectly is
that SX/Y fields exceed maximum value (2047) by itself when he
calculates DMA address to access the memory region: the value of SX/Y
fields would be increased by Mixer controller internally until reaching
width or height, and in turn the value would exceed 2047.

So I think it'd better to use existing codes because this patch isn't
tested so not safe. You can add more comments enough to existing codes
if needed.

In addition, it seems that Exynos5422/5430 has no such limitation but
they are much different from old ones so we would need new drivers for =
them.
