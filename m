It will work, sure. But the compatible list should also list the
specific CPU. From the S/W point of view there are likely
implementation-defined registers which mean that no real CPU will be
"just" an ARMv8 core.

We have enough trouble with DTBs for 32-bit SoCs not listing things they
should. I see no reason to be lax here.

Why not do this from the start? Then we can actually rely on the DTB
rather than it being useless.

Is GH7 an SoC or a CPU?

Are the clocks always-on, fixed-rate clocks, or does some firmware
manage them dynamically? We have bindings for the former.

There's not much point having a DTS upstream that relies on hacks which
are not.

Cheers,
Mark.
