Other than my earlier comments on the extra exynos_tmu_initialize()
and sysfs "mode" disabled entry, I noticed that there are some unused
extern declarations for default_tmu_data in exynos_tmu.h. Otherwise, I
have tested this on a 5420 and it look good.

I will be posting my exynos7 driver modifications based on this patch
set soon, do take a look.

Thanks,
Abhilash
