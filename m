I'd think it's the pinctrl driver's responsibility to make hogging work
correctly across suspend/resume.

The "client" driver would definitely have to be involved there, I agree.

Well, the difference in time between "just before driver binding" and
"during probe" is minimal. If the driver/HW really needs to explicitly
differentiate between those states to save power, I'd assert that it's
covered by case (2) above.

I agree; the Samsung GPIO bindings were surprising to me when I first
realized what was in the GPIO specifiers...
