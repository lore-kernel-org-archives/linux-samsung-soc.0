That would address the "easy to update in the field" side of the story.  
So far I've not seen this aspect been addressed with a serious plan 
anywhere.

Sure.  But then you might want to consider that some usage scenarios 
might benefit from the ability to abort a request, or monitor the 
progress of a request for software timing purposes, or accept parallel 
requests rather than serialize them, etc.  Given the flexibility to 
extend beyond a rigid interface, the system may become even more 
efficient overall, albeit with added complexity in the implementation. 
But for that to work it has to be cheaply achievable.

This is not really a policy.  This is a straight-forward waterfall 
dependency.  There is simply nothing you can do with those CPU clock 
cycles when stalled most of the time waiting for memory queries to come 
back so the choice is obvious.  If however this has a significant impact 
on code execution speed then this becomes a tradeoff and the choice to 
use this feature or not (the policy) must be implemented in software.
