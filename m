Yes.

Tracing the history ... I think we could have done without

04abf5daf7d  dma: pl330: Differentiate between submitted and issued descriptors

    The pl330 dmaengine driver currently does not differentiate
between submitted
    and issued descriptors. It won't start transferring a newly submitted
    descriptor until issue_pending() is called, but only if it is idle. If it is
    active and a new descriptor is submitted before it goes idle it will happily
    start the newly submitted descriptor once all earlier submitted
descriptors have
    been completed. This is not a 100% correct with regards to the dmaengine
    interface semantics. A descriptor is not supposed to be started
until the next
    issue_pending() call after the descriptor has been submitted.


because the reasoning above seems incorrect considering the following
documentation...

Documentation/crypto/async-tx-api.txt says
  " .... Once a driver-specific threshold is met the driver
automatically issues pending operations.  An application can force this
event by calling async_tx_issue_pending_all(). ...."

And

include/linux/dmaengine.h says
  dma_async_tx_descriptor.tx_submit(): set the prepared descriptor(s)
to be executed by the engine

so theoretically a driver, not starting transfer until
issue_pending(), is "broken".
At best the patch@04abf5daf7d makes the driver slightly more
complicated and the reason behind confusion such as in this thread.
