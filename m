That's your implementation, which cannot be generalized. PPIs can
perfectly be wired (and definitely *are* wires in ARM implementations)
from the device all the way to the redistributor, where it effectively
becomes message-based in an architecturally defined way.

They do exist at the physical level, at least in a number of non-Cavium
implementations.

That's fine by me. I'll drop the ThunderX changes from this patch.
