Hi,

Thanks for looking into this.

I read that diagram a bit differently.
The default state of the output is high, but that is while PWM is
"inactive". It goes low at the point when the timer starts, and it
also goes low when the timer later restarts every time. So once we
enable PWM the output should be low.
It will go high once TCMP == TCNT, but because TCMP is placed at the
maximum value which is never hit, that will never happen, so the LED
stays off.

But I am confused on a few counts here...

I may have identified above why a maximum TCMP value would not result
in the output going high, but then why does the rest of the brightness
scale work? If I set brightness 200 (tcmp=6470, tcnt=29999) then the
LED is on dimly. If I set brightness 254 (tcmp=117, tcnt=29999) then
the LED comes on much brighter. But according to my above explanation
and looking at the diagram you referenced, such a decrease in the tcmp
value would result in a shorter time for which the output is high,
i.e. lower brightness, but actually the brightness increases.

If the output is high by default, why don't I see the LED turning on
in uboot before Linux has even loaded?

Does the above diagram really apply to Linux? Because Linux sets the
invert bit for all the channels in pwm_samsung_probe. So maybe that
diagram is irrelevant until we invert the TOUT signal shown there?
