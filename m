Hi Tomasz,

I'm sorry for late reply.

I got with slight confusion.
Do you mean that you want to remove the 'eint_res_idx' because
it is always zero(0) as your comment. And do you agree to add 'pctl_res_idx'?

Also, as you commented, the eint_res_idx for both GPA and GPFx is zero(0).

Example:
	pinctrl_alive: pinctrl@10580000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5433-pinctrl";
                      /* ALIVE domain    ,  IMEM domain  */
		reg = <0x10580000 0x1a20>, <0x11090000 0x100>;

		wakeup-interrupt-controller {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos7-wakeup-eint";
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 0>;
		};
	};

	GPA's eint_res_idx is 0
	GPA's pctl_res_idx is 0

	GPFx's eint_res_idx is 0
	GPFx's pctl_res_idx is 1


 However it should be still beneficial to refactor the code

I agree. I'll modify it according to your comment.
