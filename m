Those headers are now used by both: framebuffer and Exynos DRM
driver. And probably the framebuffer driver has more users, as it
also covers older FIMD devices than those found on exynos4/5 SoCs.

So include/video seems equally right (or wrong) as include/drm.

There have been some efforts, or at least requirements raised, to
create some common low level API for framebuffer and DRM drivers,
but nothing has clarified yet AFAICS.
