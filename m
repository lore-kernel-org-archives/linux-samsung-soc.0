I think we want all of it but Doug's optimization 3252a646aa2c
("clocksource: exynos_mct: Only use 32-bits where possible") is not
ARM64 friendly. One way of dealing with it would be to prepare two
versions of exynos4_read_current_timer(). One reading only lower 32-bit
value for ARMv7 and second (slow) reading lower and upper for ARMv8.

No, there is no real advantage... except that the SoC has some
interesting "characteristics"... The timers are tightly coupled. Very
tightly. I spent a lot of time and failed to boot my ARMv8 board without
some MCT magic.

Best regards,
