Ok, thanks.

You defined yourself "not a small thing", you know what you are doing
and that's enough for me. Please respect that when I reviewed it I thought
that was a hack. cpu_suspend is being used for many things in the kernel
and consolidating that took a while, please comment the code, that's all I
am asking you.

ACTLR.SMP for the sake of precision and it was my typo, sorry. That's
all I wanted to read, so nothing to add.

I agree.

You have a point, as long as we are all aware and we do not forget this
is a major problem, not a minor one. I do want to see a consolidate
story for CPUidle for ARM and this bullet is definitely part of the
picture. On a side note, you made me smile, it sounded like I wanted
to bury SPC code in firmware or anywhere else as long as it is not in the
kernel, which in a way is a true statement since I abhor that code =)

I wanted to say Nico that those operations are so intrinsic for all ARM
cores you can almost think of them as part of the ISA and certainly
HW knows it better than SW when a processor has nothing to do, it does
idle core units all the time without software interaction, going power off
(on cue) could just be one step further and solve those pesky races in HW.

We can debate this offline, it is an interesting topic in particular on
the performance critical side of things; as for firmware see my point
on security, as I already mentioned.

That's your opinion and I respect that. What I said, and that's a fact
not an opinion, is that if those operations are required to be secure in a
platform, there is not much you can do apart from preventing races where the
race conditions are, ie in secure world.

I agree on the spirit of the patch, my concern was about its implementation.

Thank you, this was a constructive discussion.
