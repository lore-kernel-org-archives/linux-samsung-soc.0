It depends how you look at it.  I decided that since the previous code had
been there for a while (since 3.19), it should stay the default.

I agree you could look at it differently.

Again, it depends how you look at it.  From my point of view, the
specification doesn't cover external regulators so you can't expect to know
what to put in the power control register.

So if I make the same change to sdhci-of-at91 as sdhci-pxav3, it will work
for you?

But always the possibility it won't work for some driver.

At least it means we can go forward.
