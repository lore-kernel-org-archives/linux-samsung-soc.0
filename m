Yes, I was referring to calling clk_get() with NULL 'dev' argument.
Usually, at boot, the clock frequency of some of the system clocks
(such as aclk_200) are displayed. So all the clocks were registered
using clk_register allowing clock frequency of any the clock to be
retrieved using clk_get.

Your suggestion to use of_clk_get assumes the clock implementation
follows the imx style, which was not way used in this patch series.
And then there is this problem of supporting non-dt platforms as well.

Yes, true.

Ok.

Ok. I will implement it as you mentioned.

Ok. Thanks for your comments. I will redo this patch series and post them.
