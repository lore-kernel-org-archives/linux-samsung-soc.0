Good question goes to Samsung maintainers.
I can find unanswered mail thread:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2014-May/258576.html
Let me quote Kukjin: " Basically the two blocks are connected and the
arch timer uses the count value from MCT for reference"

Right. I like the idea to use arch_timer. Odroid-xu3 works fine with it.
Looks like Samsung have some games with power management stuff that
can't be opened/told and they use MCT that works well for their needs.
This draft patchset is only about little speedup of MCT operations
that still here and used.

To start arch timer we may need to initialize G_TCON register in MCT
like it's done in Xen:
http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=blob;f=xen/arch/arm/platforms/exynos5.c;h=79e3a5faf9fa6f37d99040f85c6dccbd9312c856;hb=HEAD
in exynos5_init_time(). I guess not all bootloaders properly
initialize MCT on Exynos5 boards.

If addition of similar platform callback and enable of arch_timer are
steps in right direction I can take a look on it.
Or as suggested in one mail thread: if MCT is present in DT then MCT
driver lookup arch_timer in dt, find it, initialize G_TCON reg and
gives up to allow arch_timer to do it job (in that case we need to
init MCT before arch timer).

Yep. That's why probably MCT isn't used on arm64.

Yep, just only one of the initial points to understand is it any use trying.
Thanks.
