You mean that:
  while (readl_relaxed()) cpu_relax();
is slower than
  do cpu_relax() while (readl_relaxed())
?

Hmm... Interesting. I would be happy to learn more about it why it
behaves so differently. Maybe the execution of cpu_relax() before
readl_relaxed() reduces the amount of loops to actually one read?

Indeed some parts of kernel code for ARM prefers this approach,
although still the most popular pattern is existing one (while()
cpu_relax).

Best regards,
Krzysztof
