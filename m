Busfreq/devfreq is just a Linux-specific abstraction responsible for collecting data using PPMUs and controlling frequencies and voltages of appropriate power planes, vdd_int responsible for powering DMC0 and DMC1 blocks in this case.

I knew already.

What is exactly incorrect part of this patch?

What is 'power plane'? I don't know 'power plane'.
If you suggest 'power plane' concept and then merge this concept to mainline,
After merged 'power plane' concept, I will apply 'power plane' concept to Exynos4's busfreq driver.

I prefer to handle 'power plane' concept on other patchset for Exynos4's busfreq driver.
