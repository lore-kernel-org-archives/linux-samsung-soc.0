As you know, the driver sets RUDR bit to high always before reads time.
I'm not sure whether any delay time needs to guarantee that RUDR bit is
set properly, but it fails keeping time.

I tried setting RUDR bit to high after or before setting WUDR bit to
high for writing of RTC_CTRL register but it also fails keeping time.
If achieve keeping time, i should set WUDR & RUDR bits to high at the
same time.

I'm referring also rtc-sec driver source of SM-N910U_SEA(Samsung Note4)
from SM-N910U_SEA_KK_Opensource.zip file[1]. It also does the same
operation setting WUDR & RUDR bits to high for writing of RTC_CTRL
register.
