drm_panel.c is missing kerneldoc as well, though I have a local patch to
add it. If nobody else steps up I'll take this.

With this series bridges are no longer part of the DRM device and it's
the driver that provides them that needs to free them (in ->remove()).
It's not a completely perfect solution yet, but with the registry patch
that I proposed a while back all the remaining issues should go away.
Now if I could get anybody to look at that patch...
