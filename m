PPMU(Performance Profiling Monitoring Unit) is to profile performance event of
various IP on Exynos4. Each PPMU provide perforamnce event for each IP.
We can check various PPMU as following:

PPMU_3D
PPMU_ACP
PPMU_CAMIF
PPMU_CPU
PPMU_DMC0
PPMU_DMC1
PPMU_FSYS
PPMU_IMAGE
PPMU_LCD0
PPMU_LCD1
PPMU_MFC_L
PPMU_MFC_R
PPMU_TV
PPMU_LEFT_BUS
PPMU_RIGHT_BUS

DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) control the operation of DRAM in Exynos4 SoC.
If we need to get memory bust utilization of DMC, we can get memory bus utilization
from PPMU_DMC0/PPMU_DMC1.

So, Exynos4's busfreq used two(PPMU_DMC0/PPMU_DMC1) among upper various PPMU list.

If vdd_int is connected to buck3 of PMIC(Power Management IC),

We can see the flow of provided power as following:
: external power --> buck3 pin of PMIC --> vdd_int pin of Exynos4 SoC --> DMC IP and PPMU IP of Exynos4 SoC
