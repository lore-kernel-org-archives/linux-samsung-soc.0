Hi Marc,

OK. I agree with Will and your opinions and I think Changhwan can fix it as
per your suggestion, but he needs fixed/updated regarding gic codes to avoid
re-work and conflicts with others. So it would be better to us if he could
fix it after merging your patches even probably at the end of upcoming merge
window. I hope he can do it before v3.2-rc1.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
