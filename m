Because if the name without any unique email address is included in
the description,
I think that it is not appropriate. Always, the information should
include the email address.
So, I just prefer to use the Suggested-by or the different kind of tag
with [id: explanation].

But, I'll stop about it because it is not critical issue.
It depend on what is the preferred method to add the information.
