Oh yes, this is it.

I know what happened now. This series was already queued for 3.11 in 
Samsung tree. After a bit of testing in linux-next Bart found the build 
error and sent a fix, which was going to be merged for 3.11 as well. 
However since there have been some problems just before merge window 
started, this series had to be dropped, including the fixup patch.

Thanks for reporting. Let me try to sort this out.

Best regards,
Tomasz
