Certain task  tends to run slow in current thermal zone setting.
If needed I will send a patch for this.

What I meant was to support more trip point to address below.
[    2.776320] exynos-tmu 100a0000.tmu: More trip points than
supported by this TMU.
[    2.782370] exynos-tmu 100a0000.tmu: 2 trip points should be
configured in polling mode.

Ok fan should work on all the thermal zone. To avoid thermal shutdown.

But I want to avoid scaling down of all the cores of cpu to low freq
as cooling-maps cross the alert temperature. For below example.
----
 map3 {
              trip = <&cpu1_alert3>;
              cooling-device = <&cpu0 0 2>;
 };
 map4 {
              trip = <&cpu1_alert3>;
              cooling-device = <&cpu4 0 2>;
 };

 map5 {
              trip = <&cpu1_alert4>;
              cooling-device = <&cpu0 3 7>;
 };
 map6 {
             trip = <&cpu1_alert4>;
             cooling-device = <&cpu4 3 12>;
 };

What I want to configure thermal zone as.

cpu0_thermal: cpu0-thermal {
     configure cluster of cpu[0-3]
     {
        tips
     }
     cooling map
     {
         device handle cpu[0-3] with frequency scaling at particular
alert temperature.
     }
}

cpu1_thermal: cpu1-thermal {
     configure cluster of cpu[4-7]
     {
        tips
     }
     cooling map
     {
         device handle cpu[4-7] with frequency scaling at particular
alert temperature.
     }
}

We can chose to configure rest of the thermal-zone on this approach.
Please share your thoughts.
