It is not related to this problem. If you wish to address different
problem related to non-optimal choice of temperature, then please send a
separate patch explaining chosen values.

There are 4 CPU thermal zones on Exynos5422. What do you want to expand?

I miss the point behind this. Why fan should work only when CPU4
(tmu_cpu0) is heated and not CPU5-7 (rest of cpu tmu's)?
