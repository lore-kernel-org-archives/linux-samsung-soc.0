Not true. I only try to find the best solution and the approach with
multiple re-probing just to avoid potential bugs in drivers does not
look to me correct.

This sound so funny, just look at componentize patches - every patch
adds two stage initialization for every component and the master,
with forced unwinding and two levels of devres management.

'My approach' adds only one call to probe and one call to remove of
components,
and very simple and straightforward interface to the master.

'My approach' is very standard - during probe driver probes hardware,
and registers interfaces which can be used by other drivers, for example
by drm master. The only addition is reporting its readiness. Comparing to
'your approach' it is bloody simple.

Volume of changes for each component and drm device management
dispersed on all components makes your argument very valid for
component subsystem.

Btw have you observed component framework when one of the components
during bind returns -EPROBE_DEFER ? In my tests it resulted in
deferred probing of master and unbind/bind of other components.
So lets say you have N components and the last component will be deferred
K times, it results in:
- K times deferring of the last component and the master,
- (N - 1) * K - unbinds and binds of other components.

I think I have answered you two or three times that it is not a problem
to remove
'glued drivers' restriction. I desperately try to avoid accusing you for
'desperately
playing down' on this subject, so I will not comment this anymore.

On the other hand you have not answered quite important question - how
do you plan to componentize drivers shared by different drms when
one of drms is not componentized???
