Thanks for the clear explanation.

The i2c aliases are a bit confusing. The original device the driver was
written for was called qt602240, which was renamed by Atmel to mXT224 when
the chip series was called "maXTouch". The driver now actually supports
many other chips which aren't listed (more than 20 devices that I've
personally tested). I could add them all, but it would be an extremely long
list. It may be preferable to use the generic name maXTouch.

So I think the sensible thing to do here would be to add "maxtouch" to the
i2c list to fix the module autoload issue.
