May I suggest we go ahead and apply this patch to fix the problems for
Arndale Octa!? I am soon about to send the PR for 3.18.

We should then follow up on this discussion and sort out why/how it
actually works.

So, I need an ack from some of the ARM SOC maintainers. I have looped
in Arnd Bergmann, if Kukjin is busy.

Kind regards
Uffe
