OK, so please see the message I've just sent. :-)

The bottom line is that there may be multiple ways to approach a
problem like this and which of them works best really depends on the
particular case.

You seem to be thinking that the device links infrastructure may not
be necessary after all if there are other ways to address the problems
it is intended for, but those other ways may still be less viable
practically due to the complexity involved and similar.  Also they may
lead to code duplication in different places that try to address those
problems in a similar fashion, but slightly differently.

All this is about providing people with reasonably straightforward and
common ways to deal with certain class of problems showing up in
multiple places.  It is not about getting the driver probe ordering
right magically in one go.

Thanks,
Rafael
