I tried to get a datasheet for Exynos 54xx but could not find it. I even
looked at the public 5250 data sheet, but it is completely missing
Chapter 34, "Audio Subsystem", which apparently contains Figure 34-3,
"Clock names and clock tree diagram of MAUDIO_BLK".

So without any clue about your hardware (not for lack of trying) I would
guess that somewhere in the parent hierarchy you have an interface clock
which must be enabled in order for you to touch the registers pertaining
to the downstream audio clocks.

The right way to handle this requires two steps:

1) model your interface clock in the Linux clock framework if you
haven't already (I assume it is a gate clock, or the child of a gate
clock)

2) the clk_ops callbacks for the affected audio clocks should wrap their
operations (i.e. critical secion) with a clk_enable/clk_disable pair,
where the clock being enables/disable is the interface clock mentioned
above in #1

The CCF is reentrant, so you can do this by simply using the top-level
clk.h API from within your clk_ops callbacks.

I might be totally wrong about the cause of the hang, but that's my best
guess based on everyone's bug reports.

Mike
