Sorry, I don't understand what problem you have with this design. It 
completely meets all the requirements applicable on hardware platforms it 
is (and going to be) used on.

The only thing it would do in a suboptimal way would be synchronization of 
register accesses for multiple instances of the driver - one spinlock 
would be used for all of them. This is insignificant because there is no 
time critical code in this driver and it is really unlikely that a SoC 
with multiple instances of this IP block shows up.

Channel reservation between clocksource and PWM drivers is completely 
correct, relying on the fact that the former can only use channels 
_without_ outputs and the latter can only use channels _with_ outputs. Do 
I have to add that there can't be a channel both with and without output?

So the only place for improvement here, without starting overengineering 
things, is a comment about the purpose of the spinlock and why it can be 
used in our case.

Best regards,
Tomasz
