Ok, I've checked mmc-prwseq and mmc-pwrseq-simple. I also checked the
hardware and it mmc-pwrseq-simple cannot be used directly.

Although the signal is called RSTN (on Odroid U3 schema), the eMMC card
gets resetted not on low line level, but during the rising edge. This RSTN
line is also pulled up by the external resistor. However, the strangest
thing is the fact that the default SoC configuration (which is applied
during hw reset) for this GPIO line is input, pulled-down. The SoC
internal pull-down is stronger than the external pull up, so in the end,
during the SoC reboot the RSTN signal is set to zero. Later bootloader
disables the internal pull-down.

To sum up - to perform proper reboot on Odroid U3/XU3, one need to set
RSTN to zero, wait a while and the set it back to 1.

To achieve this with mmc-pwrseq-simple, I would need to modify the power_off
callback to toggle reset line to zero and back to one. This however might
not be desired to other sd/mmc cards used with mmc-pwrseq-simple.

I can also provide separate mmc-pwrsrq-odroid driver, which will be very
similar to mmc-pwrseq-simple.

Ulf - which approach would you prefer?

emergency_restart() doesn't call device_shutdown(), so I think it still 
makes
sense to add real reset handler to mmc-pwrseq to ensure that power_off will
be called even during emergency_restart().
