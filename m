They were merged on 27th November, so they would've been in linux-next
from about last Monday.  Nishanth reported a failure on Friday, the
last week day before the merge window opens.  There's no time to try
and fix this before the merge window, which is why I decided to drop
it.  They have already been dropped.  They were dropped immediately
after my message on Friday was sent.  So they've not been in linux-next
over this past weekend.

We don't push known broken code in during the merge window.  The merge
window is the exact time when subtle bugs are likely to be introduced,
and is the exact time that you want bisect to work.  If we push known
broken patches into the kernel during that period, we break the ability
to use bisect to find problems, especially where it causes a platform
to become unbootable.
