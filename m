Hi Tyler, Kevin,

>From the bootlog you have shared,

[    1.060016] CPU4: failed to come online
[    2.070031] CPU5: failed to come online
[    3.080049] CPU6: failed to come online
[    4.090066] CPU7: failed to come online
[    4.090099] Brought up 4 CPUs
[    4.090109] SMP: Total of 4 processors activated.
[    4.090119] CPU: WARNING: CPU(s) started in wrong/inconsistent
modes (primary CPU mode 0x13)
[    4.090128] CPU: This may indicate a broken bootloader or firmware.

Would it be possible to set max cpus to 1, disable switcher and try
again. I don't have a arndale octa board but I have tested mainline
kernel with smdk5420 board. It boots all eight CPUs, switcher works
fine and there are no imprecise aborts seen.

Thanks,
Thomas.
