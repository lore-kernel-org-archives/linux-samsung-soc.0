That property looks very reasonable.

Question: This would be a non-backwards-compatible change to the binding
definition. How should this be handled? In the past, I believe it's been
stated that new kernels need to run against old device trees, and hence
once a DT binding was defined and in use, it couldn't change except in a
backwards-compatible way. However, more recently, Grant has said that
his opinion is that (some or all?) bindings are currently considered
experimental and subject to change. And besides, the .dts files are
contained in the kernel tree at present... Some generally stated and
agreed upon policy here might be useful.

I'm not sure about those two: Some of the GPIO bindings have flags in
the GPIO specifier (Tegra, ARM PL061, gpio.txt mentions the possibility
of polarity being in the specifier), and bit 0 of the flags is used to
indicate inversion. I think that either we should rely on GPIO
specifiers having such flags and remove these xxx-inverted properties
from the MMC binding, or remove that flag bit from the GPIO bindings.

Note that anything using of_gpio_simple_xlate() is going to end up using
the GPIO flag definitions from <linux/of_gpio.h> in their GPIO
specifier, and there a number of active users of this feature; grep for
OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW.

The rather begs the question why of_get_named_gpio() exists; surely
of_get_named_gpio_flags() should always be used so that consumers know
whether the GPIO value should be inverted, or are the GPIO flags
supposed to be processed by the OF/GPIO core or GPIO driver somehow, and
act transparently to GPIO consumers?

Isn't that usually pluralized, so interrupts?

For the device-specific binding documentation, rather than repeating the
core bindings, shouldn't we say something like:

This binding is based on the core MMC bindings documented in mmc.txt.
This file only documents additions or changes to those bindings.

... and then remove any of the common properties from the individual files?

Ah OK, so the first phase is to add all the new standardize properties,
then later remove all the legacy properties once the drivers have been
updated.

You've missed additions of "non-removable", but I can add them later. or
provide you an incremental patch or something.

This doesn't seem to decode cd-inverted, or do anything with the
bus-width property value that it reads. Was that intentional?
