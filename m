Looks like it.

I will be doing a lot of cleanup of PM code for Samsung platforms starting 
from next week. Mostly low level suspend/resume handling (Samsung PM core), 
but since AFTR mode has much in common with sleep mode (e.g. both go 
through s5p-sleep.S after waking up), so I can look at this issue too, on 
our internal boards and Origen.

As for L2 suspend/resume on Samsung platforms, it has to be reworked 
completely, because on newer boards which have secure firmware it can't be 
resumed normally, because this requires calling several firmware operations. 
I already have patches for this, but need to do more testing, including 
checking how this interferes with things like AFTR mode.

Best regards,
Tomasz
