What we can do is have an inhibit flag for
simplefb/simpleuart/simplewhatever that holds off PM. When a real
driver, or a stub that understands parsing the resource dependencies,
takes ownership of the device (or userspace tells the kernel to stop
caring) it can clear the inhibit.

I don't want to build knowledge of resource dependencies into the
simple case. We'll simply frequently get it wrong. For example: A
future kernel will have better PM and will turn off more devices which
isn't accounted for in an older DT.
