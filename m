You are right, the sequence is wrong. The host->bus_hz is set to the
correct value of 100Mhz in set_ios callback of exynos. But much prior
to that, the dw_mci_init_slot is called and that initializes
mmc->f_min to host->bus_hz / 510 = 400Mhz / 510 = 768KHz.

To fix this, I am planning to add another implementation specific
callback function that will adjust the host->bus_clk as per
implementation specific extensions. This callback will be called right
from dw_mci_probe right after the host->bus_hz is set using the
clk_get_rate() call.

Sorry, I was not paying proper attention to the log messages. Thanks
for your correction.

Thomas.
