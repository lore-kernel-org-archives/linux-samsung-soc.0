Now that we have a broader agreement on this, I think we can go ahead with the
following steps as an initial approach:
1. Have a common machine file for both exynos4 and 5 files, mach-exynos-dt.c.
2. Introduce a generic compatible string "samsung,exynos".
3. Append this to the compatible property list for existing boards.

If this plan looks OK, I can send across patches doing this.
