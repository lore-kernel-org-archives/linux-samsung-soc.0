I haven't seen this kind of set up before. Are you invoking
pm_runtime_enable() here as well?

I am not sure pm_runtime_get_noresume() is a good idea, since that
will prevent the device from going inactive - even after the driver
has probed it. Unless the driver do pm_runtime_put_sync twice of
course. :-)

On the other hand, if you have done pm_runtime_enable() your certainly
need to prevent the device some going inactive...

Unfortunately no.

I am using the DT initialization path so all my devices aren't being
added to the PM domain before drivers starts to probe them.

Instead they are added when each device gets probed, thus the PM
domain can still power off between devices being probed.
