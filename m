Perhaps let's limit this patch to s5pv210 and Exynos5410 alone, where
a simple swap of bank order in the arrays should be okay.

We might also need to have some fixes on 4x12, because I noticed that
in exynos4x12_pin_banks0[] there is a hole in eint_offsets between
gpd1 and gpf0 and exynos4x12_pin_banks1[] starts with gpk0 that has
eint_offset equal to 0x08 (not 0).

Agreed. Probably the only safe way of documenting this is to put it
inside each bank array, so that when someone creates a copy/paste for
new SoC, the comment is clearly visible... Perhaps something like:

/* Must start with EINTG banks, ordered by EINT group number. */

Best regards,
