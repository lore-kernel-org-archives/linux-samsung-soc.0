Hi,

I was just tackling a similar bringup problem regarding an embedded usb hub 
and usb-sata bridge and stumbled upon this series.

While on my (rockchip-)boards it's always "just" a reset pin that needs 
handling, this series looks like it would solve exactly that problem in a very 
nice way.

So while I cannot provide any meaningful insight right now, it would be cool 
if you could keep me in the loop, as I'm really looking forward to this series 
progressing.


Thanks
Heiko
