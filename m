I am not sure I agree with Rafael there:

 - when we are talking about the latest incarnation of power domains it
   is not really platform specific anymore (as it was when we were
   dealing with ACPI only case);

- I do not see why sirincling platform specific code around i2c, spi,
  etc bus code (which is not platform-specific) is OK, but a no-no for
  the driver ocre.

I think so - you would have complete picture of your power domain,
including data exposed in debugfs, etc.

Hm, OK. I guess the title of the patch series thrown me off because as
far as I am concerned it is not a race, we simply were not powering the
domain properly for probing.

Thanks.
