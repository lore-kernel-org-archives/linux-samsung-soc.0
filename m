The original idea from Marek was to mark everything unstable. After
comments from Rob I made it weaker already by changing to specific group
of compatibles. Accepting their instability does not mean that we will
be doing this on whenever possible. It just opens the possibility of
finding some balance in cleanups and development. Sometimes things have
to be seriously changed (fixed) and implementing workarounds for
existing ABI might be huge work by itself.

IOW, we want stability but not with the costs of huge development
efforts... because no one else except us cares about the stability.

They became unstable in a subjective way so I assume that reverse is the
same, based on consensus and discussions.

I am not sure if a hard time limit is good. There is no timeline for the
Exynos development, no public roadmaps but rather community and
partially volountary effort.  Therefore whatever number we set, it might
be totally not matching reality.

Hmm, I see that some existing bindings are being added with "Unstable"
warning:

	git grep -i unstable Documentation/devicetree/

so there should be no problem for putting there a timeframe.

Some architectures are using overlays for handling backward
compatibility. Anyway it might put additional effort on driver
development.
