At some point you have to realize that what you're proposing is not 
viable when taking into account the bigger picture.  And your FW 
architecture is to blame.  If you were running Windows instead of Linux 
I bet you'd have found a way to fix things differently than asking 
Microsoft to add a special quirk in their code.  In the PC world you are 
required to perform a BIOS update instead.

So you really need to provision the ability to update at least a portion 
of the firmware that is not read-only.  That may be a third-stage 
bootloader or the like which purpose is only to install workarounds such 
as this before executing the kernel and which doesn't need to be updated 
with the kernel.  And in theory you should be able to do that on top of 
your current RO firmware.

Errata workarounds are often machine specific and they can be applied 
only in special conditions the kernel might not safely know about until 
it is too late.
