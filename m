Oh, bah humbug.  Now that I notice this I think that's the reason I
enabled runtime PM for the adaptor - it's easier to get hold of.

It's not really a platform issue - the platform bus by default does the
right thing and the runtime PM core is pure software, the only platform
dependency is if users have bothered truning runtime PM on.

To be honest I don't think this is worth it.  Either we just keep the
clock management outside of runtime PM or we push it in but trying to
support both simultaneously adds complication and doesn't actually do
all that much in practical terms.
