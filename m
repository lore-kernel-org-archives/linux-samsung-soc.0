That's also a viable option. Although, DMA clients would then need to
invoke such APIs from non-atomic contexts. Typically that would be
from client driver's runtime PM callbacks.

Me personally would rather avoid such solution, as it would sprinkle
lots of drivers to deal with this. Although, perhaps this is the only
option that actually works.

Yes, indeed. Thank you for taking the time to respond!

I didn't know about this. If you have an example from the top of your
head, could you perhaps point me to it?
