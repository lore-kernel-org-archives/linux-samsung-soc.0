This series is based on v3.19-rc5 tag of Linux-next tree at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

Changes since V2:
	-- Address comments from Jingoo Han for ps8622 driver
	-- Address comments from Daniel, Rob and Thierry regarding
	   bridge chaining
	-- Address comments from Thierry regarding the names for
	   new drm_panel functions

Changes since V3:
	-- Remove hotplug based initialization of exynos_dp
	-- Make exynos_dp work directly with drm_panel, remove
	   dependency on panel_binder
	-- Minor cleanups in panel_binder and panel_lvds driver

Changes since V4:
	-- Use gpiod interface for panel-lvds and ps8622 drivers.
	-- Address comments from Javier.
	-- Fix compilation issues when PANEL_BINDER is selected as module.
	-- Split Documentation patches from driver patches.
	-- Rebase on top of the tree.

Changes since V5:
	-- Modify bridge drivers to support driver model.
	-- Drop the concept of bridge chain(sincle there are no 2 real bridges)
	   Hence drop bridge-panel_binder layer.
	-- Drop panel-lvds driver and accomadate the required changes in
	   panel-simple driver.
	-- Use gpiod interface in ptn3460 driver.
	-- Address all comments by Thierry Reding for V5 series.
	-- Address comments from Sean Paul for exynos_dp_commit issue.

Changes since V6:
	-- Panel patches were separated and they are merged already.
	-- Fix few issues with ptn3460, before modifying the bridge core.
	-- Modify drm_bridge as per Thierry's comments for V6 series.
	-- Add drm_bridge changes minimally without breaking existing code.
	-- Add new features for ptn3460, step-by-step.
	-- Address comments from Thierry and Andreas for ptn3460 and ps8622.
	-- Split documentation patches from driver patches.

Changes since V7:
	-- Address comments from Tomi and Laurent:
		-- Use videoports and endpoints to represent the connection between
		   encoder, bridge and the panel, instead of using phandles.
	-- Address comments from Daniel:
		-- Make the patch description more descriptive.
		-- remove device pointer from drm_bridge, and just use
		   device_node instead.
		-- don't pass encoder pointer to bridge_attach.
	-- Address comments from Sean Paul:
		-- Remove bridge from mode_config, and pull out drm_bridge
		   functions from drm_crtc.c to drm_bridge.c

Changes since V8:
	-- Rebase on top of linux-next v3.19-rc5.
	-- Add Acked-by and Tested-by tags.
