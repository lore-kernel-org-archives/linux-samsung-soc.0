The pinctrl driver allows for activating default pin configuration
when the pinctrl driver loads. This is referred to as "hogging". But
should hog be used or not is something that needs to be decided. Some
of the factors which favor the driver explicitly setting up the pin
configuration are

1. After a suspend and resume cycle, the pin configuration registers
may be reset to default values. Hence, during resume, the pin
configuration has be redone.

2. Runtime muxing/config is possible.

3. Setting some of the config options such as pull-up by default might
start consuming power from boot time itself, which could be avoided if
such setup is done only when needed.

Adding pinctrl driver support in device drivers seems to be simple
task. And it is just one time effort which can be reused on multiple
SoC's.

The Samsung gpio dt bindings was just a bootstrap method to get device
tree support going for Samsung platforms. The gpio xlate callback was
used as a back door to setup the pinmux/pinconfig due to lack of
generic driver interface to setup the pinmux/pinconfig for Samsung
platforms. From a linux perspective, gpio and pinmux/pinconfig are
separate entities. So using gpio xlate to setup pinmux/pinconfig was
not correct but helped getting device tree enabled for Samsung
platforms. With the pinctrl framework available now, there are generic
interfaces to setup gpio and pinmux /pinconfig.

Thanks,
Thomas.
