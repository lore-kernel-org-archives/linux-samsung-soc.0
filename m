Thanks a lot for continue looking at this. I didn't have time to dig
deeper on this since last week.

I think you forgot the reference for [1] right? Since with latest
linux-next (20150402) I got:

# devmem 0x10040914
0xFFE00000 (CG_STATUS0[22:21] is 1)

So IIUC the CG_STATUS0 bits were a red herring and the real problem
is that the aclk266_g2d needs to be enabled during suspend (although
we still don't know why).

It seems were are at a dead end now. Without being able to ask the HW
Samsung folks we would never know what's going on here...

I can re-post my patches to keep aclk266_g2d enabled during suspend
in the clk driver if that is the least bad option. But it would be
great to solve this issue otherwise S2R will remain to be broken for
Exynos5420 which will be really sad.
