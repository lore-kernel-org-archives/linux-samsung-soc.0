This driver doesn't do anything at the moment since the OMAP hwmod layer
takes care of enabling the relevant clocks. So I was planning to drop it
for now.

The Generic PHY framework [3] has been merged into Greg's usb-next branch.
The operations there are pretty generic and IMO the PHY can be handled in
