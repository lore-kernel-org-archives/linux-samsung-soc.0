If we change the meaning to be:
         operating-points = <
                 /* kHz    uV          boost? */
                 792000  1100000  1
                 396000  950000    0

We are adding a modifier to the OPP definition here and does imply
every platform which may or maynot require "boost" need to indicate
that - basically fails at least my "least common" description for a
generic definition. As I had indicated in other threads -> we are back
to the discussion of "additional properties" to an OPP..
Option 1:
  - describe modifiers separately (as in boost-frequencies) - that
operate based on data from opp table.
Option 2:
  - keep adding to the description of opp as time goes by - every SoC
has it's own set of quirks that are needed for an OPP - I know that at
TI, we have certain OPPs that can only be enabled *if* "custom
hardware driver" is enabled, and similar stories. - yet another
example is enable the OPP if efuse X, bit Y is set.

Personally, looking at the various descriptions and bL, cpu-idle
states dependencies on OPPs, etc.. Option 2 is a non-scalable
approach.
