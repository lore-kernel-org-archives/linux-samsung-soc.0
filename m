My configuration is a little bit different than yours.

In my case I have a USB hub (usb3503) which is also a a i2c device
because it has to be configured through I2C.

I can add the power-sequence properties to the I2C node or as you
pointed under port using the vendor-product-id compatible. In the first
option: not many USB changes are needed. It works for me, at least as a
proof of concept.

The second solution: currently it does not work because the USB device
does not get enumerated before the power sequence begins. It would be
great if you could implement this on USB side.

Yes, that looks like what Rob wanted... Do you plan to work on it? The
power sequence is needed before device is enumerated.

BTW, if you would like to play with the patchset, it is here:
