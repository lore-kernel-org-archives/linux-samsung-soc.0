Yes, your code is working. However, your code is bug.
'struct s3c_fb_pd_win' is used not for LCD, but for windows of FIMD IP. So, 'struct s3c_fb_pd_win' should not be used to select LCD.
The mach-aquila.c uses two 'struct s3c_fb_pd_win' like you, however 'struct s3c_fb_pd_win' don't make problem with Thomas's
patchset. It is because mach-aquila.c use 'struct s3c_fb_pd_win' for only windows of FIMD IP.
We don't have to responsibility to keep wrong code. If you have kept the rule, Thomas's patch would not make the compatibility
problem with your code. Why we should keep aberration such as your code? If you want to select two LCDs, please find other way.
