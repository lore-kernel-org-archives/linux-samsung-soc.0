IMHO, it is useful. That's sure a highly integrated hardware with a lot
of peripherals, the power saving is lost in the noise but with a small
embedded device, the power saving is significant.

What I am worried about is the different SoCs being introduced in this
driver without investigating this cpu1 restriction and it sounds like
the AFTR seems to work (I have an odroid-u2 with a 4412 I will test to
check if the AFTR works on it) and nobody seems to be hurt by this and,
as you stated, there is no rational about it. That means the Exynos wil=
l
become really more and more power aggressive with 4/A15 or 8/A15 based
boards if the AFTR state is not correctly supported.

AFAICT, there is also the LPA state and the DEEPSLEEP, right ? If the
AFTR does not work, I don't see these states working too.

The cpuidle driver is critical for the new b.L architecture. If we
aren't able to put a cluster of big cpus in a power down state, we lose
the benefit of all the work made up-front at the scheduler level (eg.
small task packing, workqueue/timer migration) and more generally we
lose the benefit of the b.L architecture (except if we do some hacks
which are orthogonal to the generic approach).

I should have added this point to 4) to the mail I sent previously to
Bartlomiej...
