The each bus of sub-block has not h/w dependency among sub-blocks
and has the owned source clock / OPP table. Just they share the same
power line. So, I think that flat nodes in the example below is not problem.

Because of using the same power line, the sub-blocks would be tied
by devfreq framework only for the behavior of bus frequency scaling .
