I think you don't understand what I mean. Let me show you an example:

You have a board with a DSI panel and also a HDMI output. So you have a 
supernode pointing to FIMD, DSI and HDMI.

Now, an user finds that he doesn't need HDMI in his system, so he turns 
off CONFIG_DRM_EXYNOS_HDMI. The supernode still points at hdmi node and 
Exynos DRM core will register it as a component, but HDMI driver is not 
available and will never probe, leading the whole Exynos DRM to never 
initialize. Is this a desired behavior?

See above.

The code creating the list of components to wait for 
(exynos_drm_add_components()) doesn't seem to consider which sub-drivers 
are actually enabled in kernel config.

As I wrote, I know that current design before this patch isn't modular 
either, but this is not my concern here. See below.

My concern is that the supernode design is actually carving such broken 
non-modular design in stone. Remember that we are currently heading 
towards a fully multi-platform kernel where it is critical for such 
subsystems to be modular, because the same zImage is going to be running 
on completely different machines.

Not exactly. The approach we found does mostly the same as componentized 
subsystem framework but without _any_ extra data in Device Tree. Just 
based on the list of subsystem sub-drivers that is already available to 
the master driver.

I understand your concern. I also believe that generic frameworks should 
be reused wherever possible. However the componentized subsystem 
framework is a bit of overkill for this simple problem. Moreover, Device 
Tree is not a trash can where any data that can be thought of can be 
thrown as you go, but rather a hardware description that is supposed to 
be a stable ABI and needs to be well-thought. So, if something can be 
done in a way that doesn't require additional data, it's better to do it 
that way.

Unless it breaks so much that the system is unable to boot at all, which 
is the case. As I said, the system just hangs, like something would 
access hardware that is not properly initialized, e.g. without power 
domain or clocks enabled.

Anyway, I don't agree that regressions are allowed in linux-next, 
especially if found before applying a patch. Linux-next is a tree in 
which patches that are supposed to be ready to be pulled by Linus should 
be pushed. Of course nobody can spot all the regressions before the 
patches hitting -next and that's fine, as -next is an integration 
_testing_ tree. However even if already in -next, regressions should be 
fixed ASAP to minimize the number of fix patches needed during -rc period.

Best regards,
Tomasz
