Yaah. :-)

There is some other motivation of doing this:
* I got the review comment about the resource leak and sequencing in my 
max77620. It was silly mistake done by me  and it causes recycle of 
patch. To avoid this in future, devm_ was better option.
* Spent lots of time on unbinding test during my RTC patch. Although fix 
was not related to the devm_ but gave the impression that something we 
are doing on probe. devm_ looks straight forward.
- Some of code quality tools suggest to avoid goto statement. Only 
possible if we dont have any code in error path i.e. return from any place.
- If we have devm_ apis for few resource and some does not support then 
difficult to use them as this affect the sequence of deallocation. 
Existing devm_ can be used effectively only if we have all resource 
allocation using devm_.
- Reducing code size always better.
