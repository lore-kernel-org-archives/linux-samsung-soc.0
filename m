I was actually considering exporting it as both a gpiolib call
and a call which is s5p specific, say s5p_map_gpio_irq() which
odes the neessary chip mampping.

At the moment, we don't release the interrupt range once we get
it as there's no call in gpiolib to reverse to_irq() and even
if you release the irq, it is still possible the driver will
have noted the irq number and then re-request it.
