That is what I meant; Sorry for my poor English :-)

One of my recent experience is that a display controller (FIMD) driver
of a SoC manages two different context of power management:
One is turning on and off display screen (LCD) (which is as usual as previous SoCs)
and the other is gating its internal clock including System MMU very
frequently to reduce power consumption.
Because System MMU driver holds its clock ungated while it is enabled,
FIMD driver explicitely disable System MMU.

Yes, well designed FIMD driver must care about balancing of
disabling and enabling System MMU between different contexts.
But the design of some complex driver may be poor in few features due to
agressive development schedule sometimes.

Please let me think about the counting.

Now I also think the system mmu driver does not need to make
an extra effort for some special cases.
