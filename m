I actually did just this today based on this discussion, and I'll do
it through the next staging cycle to keep a track of the "arm backlog"
of how much is sitting in maintainer trees vs what has already been
merged into Russell's tree or arm-soc. We can include these stats in
next rounds "last call for patches" email to help catch forgotten
branches.

I merged rmk's for-next branch with the arm-soc one, merged that on
top of mainline and diffed arch/arm with what is in linux-next.

Right now, plus or minus some sloppy merge conflict resolutions on my
part, the statistics are:

git diff --stat next/master -- arch/arm
[..]
 113 files changed, 670 insertions(+), 810 deletions(-)

(this diffstat does not include late/* branches since they got
included in the arm-soc side of the diff)

Most of these are rightfully still there; some changes are going
through other trees such as some PCI changes, ASoC, PM, a few fixes
that haven't been sent up to arm-soc yet, etc.  A couple of patches
seem to have been queued in for-3.4 branches a bit early (Stephen
doesn't generally want people to start queueing new stuff until the
merge window is over), but that's just a couple of them.

So, it looks like there's no major backlog left for any specific vendor=
 subtree.

What I would do myself is that if I hadn't seen the patches land in
the topmost staging tree by -rc6 or -rc7, I would ping the owner of
the tree that the patches are sitting in to make sure they go up.
Hopefully this kind of thing will be a rare scenario.
