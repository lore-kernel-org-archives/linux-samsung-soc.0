Just for my personal information, do you know why ?

Ah, ok. Thanks for the info.

Here, we are introducing some dependencies I tried to drop in the=20
different drivers.

I looked more closely at the code and especially the=20
'cpuidle_coupled_exynos_data'. I don't think it is worth to have it=20
because it adds more complexity and you have to define this structure t=
o=20
be visible from the drivers/cpuidle files.

I suggest you create an simple function in "pm.c"

int exynos_coupled_aftr(int cpu)
{
	pre_enter...

	if (!cpu)
		cpu0_enter_aftr()
	else
		cpu1_powerdown()

	post_enter...
}

and in the cpuidle driver itself, you just use the already existing=20
anonymous callback 'exynos_enter_aftr' (and mutate it to conform the=20
parameters).

You won't have to share any structure between the arch code and the=20
cpuidle driver.

Ok, sounds good.

The AFTR state worked on my 5250 very well. It is a Arndale board.


Thanks for resurrecting the patch and providing the multi core idle=20
support. I am too busy to refocus on that right now.
