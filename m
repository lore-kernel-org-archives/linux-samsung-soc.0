OK.  As I said I'm nowhere near an expert on SD/MMC, so if there's
something out there that says that turning vmmc on before vqmmc is the
right thing to do then I guess that's the answer.  I would still be
very curious to get more details on what the potential problem is.
Could you provide a reference to documentation that says vmmc should
be on before vqmmc or describe a situation where it's important?

Thanks!
