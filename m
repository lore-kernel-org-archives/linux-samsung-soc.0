Actually one thing is the real compatibility of devices and second is
the source code.

Looking at the source code, the behaviour for new exynos3250 compatible
and "samsung,exynos5420-dw-mshc" would be the same, right? This would be
a indication for reusing existing compatible. No need to create new one.

However maybe the devices aren't really compatible and using the same
compatible would prevent adding new features to Exynos5420?

Best regards,
