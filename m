I've posted an updated patch.

My fault. The documentation for this initial driver was incorrect. The 
reboot
fix has noting to eMMC_nDET signal. It should be eMMC nreset, which is 
routed
directly to SoC GPIO line with external pull-up resistor. I really have no
idea why I wrote eMMC_nDET instead of nreset.
