Very good! Thanks for cleaning the code.

Given the decision to be DT only, my only question now is if you need to
support non-DT booting systems. Do you (Exynos platforms in general) care
about booting without DT?

If not, then removing makes completely sense to me.

OK.

uhh.. OK. but, by supporting of-thermal that means drivers should never
care about loading cpu cooling. That is done via cpufreq-dt. That is why
we had the cycle with cpufreq folks, remember?

(I will have a look in your patches)

This is very good. Do you care sending feedback if you need extra
configuration or does of-thermal cover your scenarios (a part from the
amendments you already did)?

I know people (tegra and rockchip) are interested in hw trip points,
which I believe should be of your interest too. Of course, that is maybe
an off-topic for this series.

OK. I will have a look in DT changes you did. But in general, removing
support needs to be done carefully for backward compatibility :-(.

Have you tried your series with cpufreq-dt?
