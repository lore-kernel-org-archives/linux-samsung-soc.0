We need to flush the work there, or things will go wrong on unload. I
think the real fix is to make sure that the connector cleanup work
isn't run on the same work stuff as any driver bind stuff, which yes
means new separate workqueue just for this.

I guess the simple fix is to do that in the drm, but tbh I'm surprised
that driver bind/deferred probe hasn't run into this problem anywhere
else yet.
