AFAIU, the patch 9 (or entire patchset) was not build tested, did not
compile and therefore was not in linux-next. Sending something, which
was not building, to linux-next just few days before Christmas merge
window makes the schedule really tight. Especially that during
Christmas some people might be offline.

I think it should sit in linux-next for few weeks... it should sit
there already so the auto-testers would try it. At least if it were in
linux-next, the booting and few simple tests were already done, e.g.
by my boards, without any additional effort.

So please give it a time after putting it into next.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
