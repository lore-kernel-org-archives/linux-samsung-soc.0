I've been looking at the Common Clk Framework and it seems that removing the
global prepare_lock mutex and making more fine grained (i.e: per controller)
is not trivial since clocks prepare operations are propagated to the parents
so the lock is not just used to have mutual exclusion of the clocks in the
same controller but is to prevent concurrent access to the whole hierarchy.

Also, I wonder why the clock usage pattern of leaving the clock prepared and
just {en,dis}able the clock at runtime is that bad since many drivers do it?

In fact, most I2C controllers drivers manage their clocks that way and that
is why I thought that this patch had merits on its own and the fact that the
deadlock was fixed was just a nice side effect of $SUBJECT.

Finally, Krzysztof was able to hit the deadlock so this is not just about a
theoretical deadlock but an important bug that should be fixed and $SUBJECT
is a possible fix until the CCF gets rids of the global mutex IMHO.

Stephen, Mike:

Some context has already been removed in the thread (including the patch
diff) so you can find the original patch here if you need more context:
