I didn't know that use CD# line for card detect.
And if CD# voltage rails and I/O voltage rail are same voltage, it doesn't make sense.
Which card is used with same voltages? (eMMC? SD? SDIO?)

Well, I have checked Exynos5250 and 5420, but it looks like not same rails.

What card detect mechanism?

I agreed with Ulf's opinion.
