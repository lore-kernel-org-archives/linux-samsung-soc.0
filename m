Don't know about this one.

I've been letting the graphics folks and Samsung hash out the graphics
patches, so I don't think I'll be much help here.

I don't know this offhand.

Yup, I think this will be real work for someone.  I made a quick
attempt and failed at it and I haven't had time to work on it since
(and don't necessarily expect to have time in the near future)...  I
think it is possible for anyone versed in i2c to figure this out based
on what I already posted and what's in our local tree...

This is the same work as needed for pit and pi, I believe.  Perhaps
Javier or Dmitry has this on their todo list?

Perhaps tps65090 FET5?  That looks like what the device tree says in
our local tree.
