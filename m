As of now beside samsung  platforms, tegra is doing temporary parent
migration. That why i opted to implement this feature in generic code.
Here only set_parent operation is called on mux_clk. which is again
implemented in generic framework. So i dont think any other platform
specific requirements need to be taken care.

Yes true, that's why,  that information is passed during registration time.

Here it is only during set rate operation.

That will be handled separately when actual migration of cpufreq
driver will be done.

I agree with you, but i am attempting through generic framework be
keeping in mind the future usage of this feature by other platforms.
