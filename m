On x86 the lines between runtime suspend and system-suspend are blurring
with technologies like "connected standby" and in general devices moving
to suspend2idle as system-suspend state, I guess this also applies to
modern smartphone platforms but I'm not following those closely.

What this means on x86 is that the firmware is not doing any suspend
handling anymore and the OS / device-drivers get to do all the suspend.
For many devices this means that if they are runtime-suspended, and there
is no difference between the runtime and system suspend handling at the
driver level, they can be left as is, so during a system suspend they are
not touched at all (and left runtime suspended during system resume).

The "SMART" bit is really not all that smart, SMART_PREPARE means that
the drivers pm prepare callback will return positive non 0 (e.g. 1) to
indicate that the device may not be kept in its runtime suspended
state when transitioning to system-suspend, otoh when the prepare
callback returns 0 and the SMART_PREPARE flag is set then *all* suspend/
resume handling can be skipped during a system suspend.

SMART_SUSPEND means that if the device is runtime-suspended it may be left
as such, this only gets checked if the driver either does not have the
SMART_PREPARE flag, or the prepare callback indicated that skipping the
entire suspend/resume handling is not ok.

So this is not that scary, but it does require driver authors to know
what they are doing...

Agreed, they don't fill me with happiness either.

I myself was thinking in the same direction (leave the entire suspended
check at the driver level).
