well as per current implementation of drivers/serial/samsung.c we can't
do much about it.

Ideally, each SoC(if not yet, maybe in future) can have different
number/names of possible source clocks for signal generation. Let us
not depend upon even defaults(fclk, pclk etc)
Let each platform code(SoC specific) define names of all possible
source clocks and let the board init code pass on the potential source
clocks by some bit-mask(or some other mechanism) while setting the
platform data.
The samsung.c could then simply go thru the array of source clock
names and the bit-mask, in platform_data, while selecting the best possible
 source for the baud rate under consideration.
