There could be other elements added to the 'sdhci_s3c_drv_data'
structure as new variants of sdhci-s3c controller would appear in
future SoC. I am not aware of any such variations in the upcoming
SoC's but this was done taking into consideration that there could be
slight variations which the driver would have to support.

I did check few months back if sdhci-pltfm.c can be used for sdhci-s3c
drivers but due to slightly complex operations which sdhci-s3c
handles, I did not try to base samsung sdhci driver support on
sdhci-pltfm.c. So, at present, I do not have a plan to move to
sdhci-pltfm.c.
