If his updated patch is ok to me, let me reply then.

As a note, I'm preparing for new EXYNOS SoC and so some exynos stuff su=
ch as
clock can be modified. So would be better if KyongHo could update regar=
ding
arch/arm/ part based on that. Maybe in the beginning of Feb.?

Joerg, as I said, I need a topic branch for this to avoid conflict and =
I
think, now you can provide it for samsung tree.

If any problems, please let me know.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
