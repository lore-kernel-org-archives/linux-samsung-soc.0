I agree to share the regmap instance of clock controller
with syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() and then add the detailed
description about this to dt-binding documentation.


And,
This patch has the another quetion about the clocks in
exynos5_dmc_init_clks(). This functions used 'clk_set_parent'
to make the hierarchy between clocks. I think it is possible to make
the relation of clocks in DT by using the 'assigned-clocks'.
