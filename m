It was just accidental missing you in the CC .Surely i will add you in

As you can see people's have different opinion on this.When i had a
look at the other drivers in the subsystem which does in the same flow
as above.However i will change in the next version.

Yes. I will add a error message.

Tested suspend/resume with the non-removable.Will do more testing with
combination of "keep-power-in-suspend" and "non-removable".

I think if i can use mmc_regulator_set_ocr(), we don't need additional
flag.But for tps65090 mmc_regulator_get_ocr() and
mmc_regulator_set_ocr() is failing as its a fixed-regulator.
