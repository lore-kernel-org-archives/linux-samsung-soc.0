I'm not sure noirq is going to work correctly, at least not with current
callbacks. I can see a call to clk_prepare_enable() there which needs to
acquire a mutex.

Would disabling the irq in suspend callback of your wakeup device and
reenabling it in resume, while keeping their wakeup capability enabled,
work for you? Then you could resume i2c in .resume_early callback
without any issues.
