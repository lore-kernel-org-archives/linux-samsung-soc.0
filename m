Thanks for review and guidance. I separated i2c driver changes and 
posted it as v6 here [1]. DT changes and mach-exynos removal of i2c 
settings have been posted as v6 here [2]. Please do review and if OK 
let's get it merged.

[1]: i2c-driver: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5363981/
[2]: mach-exynos:
