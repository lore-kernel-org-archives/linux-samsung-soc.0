Oops, sorry, my fault.

Indeed.

Yes, from the diagram there seems to be only one clock (SCLK_PCM0) but there 
are 2 in the clock gate register (PCM Special, PCM bus). I guess it's best to
describe those as 2 clocks, and handle them in the driver this way. Instead 
of merging presumably two separate physical clocks in a single clock object.

I suppose "PCM Special" (SCLK_PCMx) is only shown on the Audio Subsystem
diagrams, since it's mostly related to the sound data flow. And the PCM bus
is the PCM IP block bus clock, which is important for inter-working of the
PCM bus with rest of the system.

One option would be to provide a dummy clock for the second PCM clock, for 
systems where it is not available. So the driver always handles two clocks.
