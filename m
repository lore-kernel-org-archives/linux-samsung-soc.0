Thanks a lot for the patch. With your changes I have some HDMI output on
my Peach Pi. But the HDMI output is broken since the resolution is very
low and the video as a lot of visual artifacts.

In your change you are also adding clock phandles for the pd oscillator
clock and the CLK_MOUT_SW_ACLK200, CLK_MOUT_USER_ACLK200_DISP1 pairs for
the parent input and input clocks of the devices attached to the pd.

And also making changes to the clocks in the clk-exynos5420 driver. Can
you please explain the rationale for those changes? I'm asking because
without your clock changes (only adding the DISP1 pd and making the
devices as consumers), I've HDMI output too but video is even worse. This
[0] is the minimal change I have on top of 3.19-rc3 to have some output.

The docs I've access to, don't have information about the clock hierarchy.
So each time there is a clock issue, I've a hard time to figure out what's
happening.

So there seems to be two issues here, one is the mixer and hdmi modules not
being attached to the DISP1 power domain and another one is the clocks setup
not being correct to have proper HDMI video output.

I didn't have this issue when testing your patch against 3.19-rc2. From your
log I see that you are testing on a 3.18.1. So maybe makes sense to test with
the latest kernel version since this HDMI issue qualifies as an 3.19-rc fix?

Since commit 2ed127697eb1 ("PM / Domains: Power on the PM domain right after attach completes")
that landed in 3.19-rc1, I see that the power domain is powered on when a
device is attached. So maybe that is what makes a difference here?

My guess is that this is again clock related. Since if I add the DISP1 pd to
the DTS and make the fimd node as a consumer of the pd, the display panel
works correctly (same than current mainline that doesn't have the node).

But, if I also make the mixer and hdmi nodes as consumer of the DISP1, then
the exynos dp driver's probe function fails as shown in [1]. In this case,
the HDMI output works and I see that the DISP1 power domain is not powered
off so the only thing I can think is that is a clocks issue.

No AFAICT, currently as I mentioned before the DISP1 power domain was removed
from the exynos5420.dtsi. So since the kernel does not know about it, should
be always on. With your patch, it should not be disabled either since it has
devices attached to and I confirmed that is not powered off anymore once all
the attached devices' probe functions have been deferred and retried again.

Thanks a lot for your help and best regards,
Javier
