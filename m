We could just check if the regulator provides the capability to change the 
voltage.

I don't see any direct way of querying the regulator for provided 
capabilities (correct me if I'm just blind), but calling 
regulator_count_voltages() on the regulator and checking if the returned 
value is 1 should be enough to assume that the regulator is fixed.

What do you think?
