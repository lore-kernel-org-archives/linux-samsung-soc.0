It is not a matter of starting from scratch or not, but rather of 
getting a reasonable IOMMU driver for Exynos in mainline in reasonable 
period of time. Usually it is much easier to just remove a stale driver 
and quickly refactor all the code at once and then add a "new" driver, 
than wasting time on submitting heaps of patches for a driver that is 
not used and does not work anyway.

In fact, we already have a working driver, based on heavily refactored 
original one in our internal tree anyway and we are just wasting time on 
waiting for next version of the original refactor series to come, while 
we could simply drop current version from the kernel, squash all of any 
changes to it into a one patch adding the new driver and submit it 
instead. Of course care would be taken to preserve any authorship 
information.

Do you have some time frame in which you may post next version of the 
series (and guaranteed time to work on it)?

Best regards,
Tomasz
