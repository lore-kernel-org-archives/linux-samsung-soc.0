I renamed these registers to better match the chip specification. The 'SYS'
register name was borrowed from S3C64XX series and is a bit inadequate in C100.

These C1XX defines were the first step to prepare the code for C110 support. 

S5PC110 register map differs completely from the S5PC100 one. These two SOCs
cannot be easily handled by the same kernel binary image without some hacks and
runtime fixups if we place them in the one kernel platform. Creating yet another
kernel platform just because of these differences would unnecessarily duplicate
a lot of code and would not use the potential of the current kernel
infrastructure (separate include directories, resource&device driver model, etc).

My idea was to introduce a sub-platforms in plat-s5pc1xx. Such sub-platforms
would be exclusive - one for C100 and one for C110. Each of the sub-platforms would
have its own include files (in mach-s5pc100 and mach-s5pc110 directories
respectively) and most of the chip differences can be handled in compile time by
proper macros. Macros for the common resources would use 'C1XX' names. In this
approach common resources (GPIO, DMA, io space and so on) can be easily defined
with C1XX defines. This also perfectly matches the current convention of common
S3C_XXX defines (i.e. S3C_PA_UART, S3C_PA_FB, S3C_VA_VICn, S3C_PA_HSMMCn, and so
on), so most of the code from arch/arm/plat-s3c/ can be reused without any
modifications. I assume that the S3C prefix would be renamed to SAMSUNG sometime
later.

Sub-platform can be easily defined by a simple choice command in
arch/arm/plat-s5pc1xx/Kconfig:

+choice
+        prompt "S5PC1xx SoC Type"
+        default ARCH_S5PC100
+
+config ARCH_S5PC100
+        bool "S5PC100"
+
+config ARCH_S5PC110
+        bool "S5PC110"
+
+endchoice

Then each sub-platform can be easily defined basing on the CONFIG_ARCH_S5PC100
and CONFIG_ARCH_S5PC110 defines.

Similar approach is used in OMAP platform (there is only one platform directory,
and the chip series is defined by a Kconfig choice option).

Right, I missed this one.
