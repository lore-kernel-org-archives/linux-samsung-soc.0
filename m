Changes in v6:
	split the patch into 2 and classified them as a patch for device
	and host. Modified to include the review comments.  
Changes in v5: 
        Reduced the case statements for better code readability. Removed
        unused macro definitions. Modified the tuning function prototype
        and definition to support tuning for both SD and eMMC cards.
Changes in v4: 
        Rebased onto chris-mmc/mmc-next branch. This patch is successfully 
        applied on commit with id de022ed3fdc14808299b2fa66dbb1ed5ab921912.
Changes in v3: 
        In the previous commits of chris-mmc/mmc-next branch, the patch with
        commit id (c0f22a2c92e357e7cb3988b0b13034d70b7461f9) defines caps2 for 
        more capabilities. This patch version deletes the member ext_caps(created
        in my earlier patch) from struct mmc_host and reuses already accepted
        caps2 member.
Changes in v2: 
        Rebased to latest chris-mmc/mmc-next branch. Resolved indentation
        problems identified in review. This patch has to be applied before
        the patch released for modifying the printk messages.
Changes in v1: 
        Case statements in switch that produce same result have
        been combined to reduce repeated assignments.
        patch recreated after rebase to chris balls mmc-next branch.
