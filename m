As we discussed off the mailing list, what we could probably do now
is to add a compile time dependency on CONFIG_DRM_EXYNOS_HDMI, a fallback
to the max98098 codec only when the HDMI driver is disabled. 

That might require modifying snd_soc_of_get_dai_link_codecs() so it can 
skip optional codecs.
