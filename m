Right.  In fact I'd be willing to bet that there are zero other boards
(other than the ChromeOS boards with similar heritage) with this TPM
that do this.  It does seem unfair to burden an Infineon driver with a
board hack when it's something they didn't have anything to do with.

...but if that's the way it has to be then that's the way it has to be...

If consensus is a board driver that's fine too.  It's really all about
coming up with some solution that will make folks happy.

Check out the bullet point about the firmware checking for kernel
cheats.  At resume time the chip actually re-loads read only firmware
out of SPI flash (no choice about this).  This read only firmware can
check the state of the mask pin (which is preserved across sleep wake)
to see if the kernel cheated.
