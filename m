Yes. The 'device-handle' will point to different memories depending on
the board/SoCs. There are boards with Exynos 5420, 5422, 5800 which are
'almost' the same, but with different memories glued on top (the PoP
LPDDR3).

For now, I would like to keep it like this (if Krzysztof also agrees
with the implementation).
