No problem. Rename gpio-signal?

Yeah - since it had become a lot more generic and a lot of 
switches/signals would probably be implemented with a pull-up resistor 
of something like that, it seemed to make sense to allow them to be 
driven as well.

True. I did it this way as this is how gpio-keys is implemented. OK, 
that has one optional parameter (autorepeat) for the block and this has 
none. Though I can also see that these probably have less in common than 
the individual lines used in gpio-keys.
