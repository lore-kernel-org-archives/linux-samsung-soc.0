That'd be sugarcoating. I don't think this is a good idea at all and
using a properly encapsulated driver with proper shared API to access
shared registers wouldn't be overengineering in my opinion. It would
in fact be good engineering.

I certainly wouldn't want any of this going to waste, and quite frankly
letting you get away with just the comment is already more compromise
than I really like.

The TI drivers used to have a similar problem and I required them to
come up with a good solution. It'd be fair to require the same of you.
But maybe I'm getting soft.
