Not sure how comes, even time I sent patches to you, I at lease build and run it once.

Sorry about English.

I would check that.

I would just what  Freescale did. It included those options entries in a sub-menu.
I don't those options should be bound either, as a board may only use one of interface or controller(like TOPEET iTOP would only use i2s. No place for SPDIF, AC97 nor PCM.)
