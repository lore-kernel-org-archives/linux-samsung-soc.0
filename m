Exactly but you won't see the dev node with the "simple-framebuffer"
compatible string in the DTS since is the bootloader that adds this
device node to the FDT before passing it to the kernel.

The bootloader shouldn't mangle the FDT (with the exception of the
memory and choosen/bootargs nodes) but simplefb is just a hack to
re-use the display HW initialization made by the bootloader.

Yes, there are no other Exynos boards using simplefb besides Snow
that I'm aware of but since Exynos DRM is working well on this board
from v4.0, there is no need for it anymore.

In fact, as explained in the commit message, it could do more harm
than good since users that are still booting with a u-boot that adds
the simplefb device node, only get a blank screen since the simplefb
driver is probed, creates a console and later the Exynos DRM probes
and re-initializes the HW creating its own console, causing this issue.

I got several reports of users that says that mainline stop booting for
them but is just that they didn't get display working. Disabling simplefb
makes display to work again so maybe this is even -rc material and should
go to stable # v4.0+
