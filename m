Right, in this patch it used the S5P64XX, S5P6440, and S5P6450 is used.
but EXYNOS patches used the EXYNOS4 prefix instead of EXYNOS4210 at
least at GPIO patch.
maybe you will rename it as EXYNOS4210 and use the EXYNOS4 as
representative prefix.

Anyway it means it will use the cpu_is_exynos4210 or similar style to
detect each cpu. and assign proper data structure
Then I recommend that create the cpu.h header file as other SOC does
and use a common macro if new one comes.

Thank you,
