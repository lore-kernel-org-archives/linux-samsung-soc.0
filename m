We write code that is proper for the assumptions we made during the
design, i.e. design decisions. Otherwise you would end up with the
driver bloated everywhere with handing things that don't make any
sense, which would be definitely _not_ easier to maintain. Of course
we can have some trivial code to enforce the assumptions, as I
mentioned before.

This is a driver for an on-chip low level device that is very, very
unlikely to be hotpluggable and almost any other driver for remaining
on-chip devices depend on it. It doesn't mean that we can't change the
design decision later, if in future it becomes feasible to load
low-level SoC drivers from modules then we can make the driver support
so.

I haven't said that samsung_pinctrl_dt_match should be kept
non-initconst. It's indeed a good idea to make it initconst as well.

10 kB in one driver. Multiply by the number of similar low level
drivers for all SoCs supported by ARM v7 multiplatform build and you
can get quite a significant number of memory saved...

That's because this is already enforced by the design of the driver model...

...and similarly the assumptions we are talking about in case of this
problem could be enforced the same way. There is already
platform_driver_probe() that is supposed to be used for such on-SoC
non-hotpluggable devices and which triggers a one-time probe.
Unfortunately it is a bit broken currently, because it can't handle
deferred probes.

Anyway, I'm not even insisting that we should keep this initconst
annotation. Just wanted to point out that there are valid reasons for
it to be useful and correct (in terms of the design decisions taken
when writing the driver).

Best regards,
Tomasz
