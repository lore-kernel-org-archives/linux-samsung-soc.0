I agree, we should be dumping PKG_ID and other chip info to know on 
which BIN sample this patch is tested on...
As far as Peach-{pit/pi} boards are concerns, this is what I can remember:
1> 5420 (PIT) -> max recommended target frequency is 1800 MHz for A15
2> 5800 (PI)-> max recommended target frequency can go upto 2000 MHz, 
with INT rail locking.
INT rail locking schemes never made to mainline, so to be safer side 
instead of bumping the clock and voltages better to keep it at safer 
range for pit and pi, probably thats why it was kept at 1800MHz.
I am not sure if the same limitation applies to Odroid-XU3 samples.
