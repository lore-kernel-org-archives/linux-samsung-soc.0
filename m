+Cc Sylwester,

This came from clk tree from Sylwester. It contains two changes in
clocks:
1. Mew clock ID - we need only the header but Sylwester provided also
   the source file change,
2. Update of frequency (used in DTS as assigned clock rate) - this
   is strictly source file change and we need it.

Overall, rework would not be trivial and it would involve Sylwester.
I think it is better to stay with this as is. I will remember the policy
for future dependencies.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
