When we do that we stop->setup->start during blanking. So our "DSS" is 
optimized to be able to do that without getting blocked. All DSI video 
mode panels (and DPI) products we have done so far have not had any 
issue with that (as long as DSI HS clock is set to continuous). I think 
this approach is less platform dependant, as long as there is no SoC 
that take more than a blanking period to reconfigure.

I think it still is OMAP specifics and doesn't belong in the panel 
drivers any longer. If you revisit this requirement in the CDF context 
where DSI ifc parameters should describe how to interface with a panel 
outside the SoC, there can't really be any dependencies on SoC internal 
routing. As you say, this is inside pinmux, so how can that affect the 
SoC external interface? I would suggest moving this to dispc-dsilink DT 
settings that are activated on dsilink->enable/disable. At least that is 
how I plan to solve similar STE SoC specific DSI config settings that 
are not really CDF panel generic, like some DPhy trim settings. They do 
depend on the panel and clock speed, but they are more product specific 
than panel driver specific. Then if there are these type of settings 
that every SoC have, then we could look at standardize those. But for 
starters I would try to keep it in product/board-DT per DSI link. So we 
should try to differentiate between DSI host and slave bus params and 
keep slave params in panel driver.
