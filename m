Well, it looks like that might not be the best way to fix the problem.

First of all, I think that drivers can reasonably expect devices to be
accessible when ->probe() runs.  This means that the core and possibly
bus type/PM domain need to make that happen.

For this purpose it may be necessary to power up the device, but doing
that from the bus type's ->probe() requires either (a) not using runtime PM
or (b) bypassing the driver callbacks somehow.  On the other hand, arguably,
if either the bus type or a PM domain provide meaningful runtime suspend/resume
callbacks, then they should be available when driver_probe_device() runs
and it should be fine to run pm_runtime_resume() at that point to trigger
the power-up at least.

Now, pm_runtime_resume() would have been sufficient to power up the device
in driver_probe_device() if it hadn't trigger the "idle" check on return.
So, if you have concerns regarding the reference counting, we could do
something like

	/* Grab a referece on dev to prevent runtime idle from being triggered by resume. */
	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
	/* Drop the reference befor probing to make the driver's life easier. */
	pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev);
	ret = really_probe(dev, drv);
	pm_request_idle(dev);

in there.  But quite frankly, I don't see the point, because

	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
	ret = really_probe(dev, drv);
	pm_runtime_put(dev);

will suspend the device properly anyway after dropping the reference.

Which we don't do anyway, because if ->probe() fails, dev->driver is cleared
by really_probe().

Well, I rather think that ->probe() should leave the device in a state
which is as close as reasonably possible to the state it was in before.
