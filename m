The v9 revision of this series has completed about 2 days of testing
now on 4210/5250/5420 boards. I will let it run for few more days. For
v8 and previous versions, the tests had completed 3 or more days. So I
really don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with this
series. It would be nice to have this series merged and we start
migrating other Exynos based boards to use generic cpufreq drivers.

Thanks,
Thomas.
