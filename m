Dear Marek,

I like these patches because as you already said, the some clocks are included in the specific power domain such as exynos5433. I want to test these patches on Exynos5433-TM2 board. But, this series don't include the Device-Tree binding patches. Could you give the additional patches for test?

Best Regards,
Chanwoo Choi
