It does not scale because we do not know what chips could be added...
and we might for example discover minor differences between 4210 and
4412 so you would have:
EXYNOS4 = 4
EXYNOS4412 = 5
EXYNOS5 = 6
or some other combinations confusing the reader in the future. Instead
just do not open-code the numbers because you do not need them (I mean
you do not need the exact values).

Great!

This does not change mine arguments - this printk does not bring any
information except that there is such device. Later you might want to
print this for Exynos TRNG. Later for other module, and other. Thus I
prefer not to add it. On the other hand that is not a reason to stop
this patch so for example you could split it into separate commit. It
is kind of unrelated change and keeping it separate will not block
everything if maintainer will not want it.

Besr regards,
