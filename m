OK, in that case I would like to keep this as separate patch once
I do all other modifications.

OK, will keep compatible as you suggested.

Yes, that case I do not need to add another function to compare compatible 
strings.
So if there is no issues in having two separate machine descriptor I will 
do this
modification in next version of patch.

OK, will move this in i2c driver and will use sysreg as syscon phandle.

Agreed.

OK, let me introduce this driver via "drivers/soc" in second revision,
there also if we think it's not proper to expose such APIs or variable
outside of the driver, I will be think to move it in under machine 
directory itself.
