Are they linux keycodes?  If so, then this property name can
probably be linux,code.  There is already precedence for that
usage in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio-keys.txt.  (I
would personally prefer "linux,key-code", but sometimes it is better
to go with existing precidence) You could also use linux,input-type as
specified in that binding.

I was specifically referring to the wakeup property, but okay, I can
see the argument that it is linux-specific because it is usage-policy
related.
