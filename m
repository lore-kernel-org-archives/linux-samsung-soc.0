So do you want to create the links during the DMAengine driver probe? 
How do you
plan to find all the client devices? Please note that you really want to 
create
links to devices which will really use the DMA engine calls. Some client
drivers might decide in runtime weather to use DMA engine or not, 
depending on
other data.

At the first glance this sounds like an ultimate solution for all problems,
but I don't think that device links can be used this way. If I get it right,
you would like to create links on client device initialization, preferably
somewhere in the kernel driver core. This will be handled somehow by a
completely generic code, which will create a link each pair of devices,
which are connected by a phandle. Is this what you meant? Please note that
that time no driver for both client and provider are probed. IMHO that
doesn't look like a right generic approach

How that code will know get following information:
1. is it really needed to create a link for given device pair?
2. what link flags should it use?
3. what about circular dependencies?
4. what about runtime optional dependencies?
5. what about non-dt platforms? acpi?

This looks like another newer ending story of "how can we avoid deferred 
probe
in a generic way". IMHO we should first solve the problem of irq-safe 
runtime
PM in DMA engine drivers first. I proposed how it can be done with 
device links.
With no changes in the client API. Later if one decide to extend the 
client API
in a way it will allow other runtime PM implementation - I see no problem to
convert pl330 driver to the new approach, but for the time being - this 
would
be the easiest way to get it really functional.

Not really. IMHO device links can be properly established once both drivers
are probed...

IMHO there might be drivers which don't want to use device links based 
runtime
PM in favor of irq-safe PM or something else. This should be really left to
drivers.
