My main problem with it is that there is no design. And as such it sets
a bad example. If I accept this into the PWM tree as is then what am I
supposed to tell the next person that comes up with a similarly broken
driver?

I've had people give me guarantees that this and that would *never*
happen only to change their minds 6 months down the road. And again,
even if it was actually true in this case, it isn't a valid excuse for
setting a bad example.

The issue is that you can't really ensure that both the clocksource and
PWM drivers use the same variant and therefore might be using different
masks.

I disagree. You actually even had a version with a halfway decent design
at some point and it was discarded. I don't think I'm asking for all
that much here. I even gave you the option of admitting that the driver
was suboptimal. All I request in return is that you mention that in the
code so that either somebody else might go and clean things up or at
least that nobody will copy from a bad example.
