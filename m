I'm not sure. But, I already sent these patches[1][2] to fix the bug
and update devfreq/devfreq-event driver.
If you mention the base commit[1][2] on cover-letter, I think there is
no problem.

I think that suspend-freq support is enough without resume-freq. After
wakeup from suspend mode, the devfreq will decide the proper frequency
level on first time of governor.

OK. I recommend that you better to implement the refcount in
devfreq_{suspend,resume}_device().

I prefer that the refcount start from zero(0). When calling the
devfreq_suspend_device(), the refcount should be increased. This way
support the all of case when calling the devfreq_suspend_device() on
various time.

devfreq_suspend_device(struct devfreq *devfreq)
       if (devfreq->suspend_count > 0) {
             devfreq->suspend_count++;
             return 0;
       }
       devfreq->suspend_count++;

       // ......


devfreq_resume_device(struct devfreq *devfreq)
       if (devfreq->suspend_count >0) {
             devfreq->suspend_count--;
       } else {
             return -EINVAL;
      }

       // ......

OK.
