Yes we could, but we don't ;) The domain_destroy path has to take care
of this anyway to be robust, so we can also take away the need to unatt=
ach
everything from a domain from the iommu-api user.

Repeated function calls are not a real performance problem in the
iommu-code in my experience. The overhead is usualle somewhere else.

 once?

In general I think we should not duplicate code. This logic was moved t=
o
the generic part for a reason and iommu drivers should use it unless
there is a very good reason not to do so.

Is I/O-TLB flushing an expensive operation?
