Yeah, because the CLKOUT pin is used for measure of the clock for debug on all
of exynos SoCs commonly.

BTW, upcoming exynos5 SoCs have two muxs for CLKOUT and each mux is controlled
by CMU and PMU, so

The mux1 for CLKOUT in CMU is used to decide which clock in each sub-domain
will be out and the mux2 in PMU is used to decide which sub-domain will be out
via CLKOUT. So I want you to consider of all of exynos SoCs including upcoming
SoCs.

Thanks,
