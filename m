No worries. :)

Anand,

Anyway I was thinking about this and discussed it even offline. This is
a little bit funny design choice because:
1. The generated interrupt (on line ONOB) is not coming from the
physical key. It is coming from the PMIC, after receiving the change of
PWRON level (which comes from the key).

2. The behaviour and correlation between PWRON and ONOB is poorly
described in datasheet. Only one place mentions it.

3. The other funny idea we had, was to add a input driver for PMIC...
but that IMHO won't solve anything. It won't even make this logically
correct.

4. What I don't like personally, that I had to discover all of it,
instead of reading this in commit message coming from you. I would like
to see the explanation of this design (ONOB, PWRON etc) in comment in
DTS. Written with your own words, not mine (which would be a
confirmation that you understood the code you wrote and sent).
Why? Because you are adding a gpio-key for something which is not a key.
Funny, isn't it? :)

5. If anyone else has some ideas how to solve this (a key-PMIC mixture),
please share!

Best regards,
Krzysztof
