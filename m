As far as I'm aware of, wake-up events from pin controllers don't go
through GIC, but rather directly to PMU, which is a dedicated unit
responsible for power management and not a standalone interrupt
controller (well actually I saw a series making it a cascaded
controller some time ago, but I'm not sure if that went in). Based on
this, I don't think we have to call set_irq_wake on GIC. Correct me if
I'm wrong, though.
