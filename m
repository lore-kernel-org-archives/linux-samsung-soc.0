Yes, absolutely. As I said, the 'mach-exynos' can support upcoming 
Samsung EXYNOS SoCs and the way is better than making mach-exynos5.

My bigger plan is finally to make current directories to 3 mach- dir. 
(mach-s3c, mach-s5p, and mach-exynos) and 1 plat-samsung directory. Of 
course, the mach- directories can be reduced later.

Firstly, as you can see, I'm merging plat-s3c24xx and plat-s5p into one 
plat-samsung directory and actually the <plat/*.h> files and dev-*.c 
files have been moved into plat-samsung. Maybe I can finish it during 
3.2-rc.

Secondary, upcoming Samsung EXYNOS SoCs will be supported in mach-exynos 
directory and this patch is required to that. For example, the EXYNOS5 
SoCs (Cortex A15) will be supported in that with other EXYNOS4 SoCs soon 
and of course it reduces code duplication :)

And then current mach-s5pxxxx stuff will be merged into mach-s5p. As I 
talked to Ben Dooks, he also have a plan to merging mach-s3cxxxx stuff.

Thanks.
