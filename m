Sorry for the terseness.

It seems like we're encoding exactly the same information twice in two
different subsystems -- I don't see the point, so I'd like to think
about how we could do better.

For example, if we're only concerned about fixed regulators, could we
just detect a fixed regulator in the driver and avoid the failing call
to regulator_set_voltage() directly, without needing to go via this
capability?  Seems like the capability doesn't tell us anything we
couldn't already have known.

Thanks,

- Chris.
