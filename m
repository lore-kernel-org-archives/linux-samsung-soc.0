87aef30e (Atul Dahiya 2010-01-29 09:08:28 +0900 82) #define S5P_TIMER_IRQ(x)    S5P_IRQ(11 + (x))

is the one to blame here.

    ARM: S5P: Change S5P_TIMER_IRQ based to 11 for SAMSUNG S5P series.
    
    Currently, S5P_TIMER_IRQ is based at the end of VICs. This patch changes
    the S5P_TIMER_IRQ base from end of VICs to 11 in ISA IRQ space.
    No of VICs varies between SOCs. This causes an exception on S5P6442.

So it looks like this was intended to re-use the ISA interrupt range
but didn't get it quite right.
