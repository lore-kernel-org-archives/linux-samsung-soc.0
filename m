Hi Girish,

I re-tested the your patch.
How about locating into dw_mci_setup_bus()?

And if compare the previously and current busmode,
I think host needs not to re-write at register.
For example,
if (slot->bus_mode == ios->bus_mode)
	return;

Then this patch looks good to me.

Best Regards,
Jaehoon Chung
