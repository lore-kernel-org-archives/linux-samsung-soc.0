This series was first posted for 3.17 and you acked the whole set but
it missed 3.17 because had as a dependency some changes in the
max77802 mfd driver. Those dependencies made for 3.17 and that's why I
re-posted it for 3.18 about a month ago.

Since we are in 3.17-rc4 already, I'm afraid that this series may miss
3.18 again, is there anything else you need from me to pick this
series? It will obviously conflict with Tomeu's "Per-user clock
constraints" series [0] so if you want I can rebase it on top of your
clk-next-tomeu-kirkwood-v2 branch [1].

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
