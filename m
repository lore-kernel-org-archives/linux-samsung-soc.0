To Yakir Yang,

Please be careful when you CC people.

I don't find the reason why you CC'ed the following people. Of course, they
look to be one of the talented developers. However, they look to be
unrelated to your patchset.

 Takashi Iwai
 Vincent Palatin
 Fabio Estevam
 Philipp Zabel


Also, please add Exynos Architecture maintainers to CC list. I don't understand
why you removed them from CC list.
 Kukjin Kim
 Krzysztof Kozlowski

Without their Ack, you will not change the codes of ARM Exynos Architecture.

Best regards,
Jingoo Han
