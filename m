This is another group of commits that was chosen since they really don't
change anything even at a binary object file level ; they just replace
module_init with device_initcall (which are identical), and remove some
MODULE_<blah> tags that are no-ops in code.  So the run time regression
risk is zero here.

More specifically, we are doing the following to these PCI files that
currently can only be built-in:

 -- remove the include of module.h ; replace it with init.h as req'd

 -- drop instances of MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE which is a no-op built-in.

 -- replace module_init (if present) with device_initcall, which is
    functionally identical once CPP has processed the source.

 -- drop instances of MODULE_LICENSE, MODULE_AUTHOR, MODULE_DESCRIPTION
    while ensuring the contained info is present in the file comments.

Build tested for allmodconfig on several arch, including ARM and ARM-64
on a recent linux-next baseline.

Some non-modular PCI files still remain with unused __exit and/or .remove
functions.  Those will be dealt with in a separate series after this.

Also note that we looked into modularizing some of the PCI_DW stuff at
an earlier time[1] but that ran into problems such as trying to create
unwind for hook_fault_code etc. that wasn't easily solved.  So we just
go with keeping the code runtime functionally equivalent to what it was.

Paul.
