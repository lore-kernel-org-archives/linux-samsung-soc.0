Since I have one of these gathering dust on my desk, it's really cool to 
see this series, thanks!

I've successfully booted that branch to a filesystem on SD card, but USB 
clearly isn't quite right - the USB 2.0 hub is powered up, but only the 
bottom right port will actually enumerate devices; the ethernet is 
nowhere to be seen. However, if I drop into the bootloader and do a "usb 
start" beforehand, it all keeps working into the kernel. As for the USB 
3.0, though, the ports report over-current conditions shortly after the 
XHCI probe despite having nothing plugged in :(

Robin.
