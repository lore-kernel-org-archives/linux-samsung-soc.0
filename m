Yes, please send new version. The DTS (code) itself looked fine, so only
the checkpatch issues are remaining.

BTW, why are you copying the files? Even if you have multiple trees
(like product/vendor kernel and mainline) then you can easily move
patches with cherry-pick, apply or am commands. Then finally just 'git
format-patch -2 -v9' and 'git send-email'.

Best regards,
