The header problem was due to splitting this patch set to -samsung and
-thermal trees.
The intention was to merge it all at once, but unfortunately it was
split.

The thermal Samsung rework has been merged, so without this DTS files
we have regression, since boards like Trats2, Odroid will not have
thermal support in 4.0 final release.

Additionally we are now at -rc1 state, so some extra time is left to
handle unexpected situation (although there shouldn't be any).
