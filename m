Just out of curiosity, are you aware of more than one implementor of
Cortex A9 on Exynos SoCs that would differ in having the need for save
and restore of those registers?

I agree that there is nothing platform specific in saving and restoring
those registers and that this should be probably handled by generic code.

However, when running in non-secure world, the only way to restore this
is to call a firmware operation, which is platform specific. Is there a
way to do something like this from proc-v7.S?

I don't see the read lock code path you mention. Could you elaborate on
this? By the way, other CPUs are still offline at this point.
