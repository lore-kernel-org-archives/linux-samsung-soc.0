Thanks for the feedback. Yes, earlier the multi-card support was buggy inde=
ed. We spent some time to debug it and got it working.

s available" as we removed all the num-slots from DT at that time.

The " num-slots property not found..." log message has already been removed=
 by 8a629d26f back in 2016. Looks like we're good on this one. In dw_mci_pr=
obe (), it has code to check pdata->num_slots. If 0, the host->num_slots wi=
ll be set to 1. So the logic of setting default num_slots seems already the=
re. But correct me if I am wrong.

Thanks,
Liming

Hrm.... it's so unlucky that your patchset comes a little late. As your pat=

Havn'e check the databook for details yet, but I think it's ok to re-introd=
uce multi-slot support if a real user benefits from it. But you need a new =
patch to silent the log "num-slots property not found, assuming 1 slot is a=
vailable" as we removed all the num-slots from DT at that time.
