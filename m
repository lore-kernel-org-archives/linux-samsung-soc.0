Yes, but that's a different issue and to be honest I didn't even realize
that the patch was trying to fix this as well. In my opinion it's best to
split this up into two patches one which fixes the OF dependency. The other
fixing the timeout issue. Cause there is more to it than just changing the type.

wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout() may return
	1) 0, if there was a timeout, waiting for the completion
	2) > 0, if the completion was completeted, the returned value
	   the  remaining time.
	3) < 0, If it was interrupt while waiting for the completion

The code currently only handles 1) and 2), but it also needs to handle 3).
Since the completion has not been completed in case 3.

E.g. something like this should work:

	if (timeout == 0)
		return -ETIMEDOUT;
	else if(timeout < 0)
		return timeout;
	return 0;
