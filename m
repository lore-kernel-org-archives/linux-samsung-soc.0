I know that those cases are different, but my point was not about it.

In your patch adding support for this second clock, you add following call
to devm_clk_get():

	data->clk_sec = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "tmu_apbif_sec");

However in device tree nodes added by this patch, you have

	clock-names = "tmu_apbif", "tmu_apbif_triminfo";

and this where my confusion comes from.

Even if Exynos 5440 does not need the second clock, it uses a different
compatible value, so you can easily distinguish the cases when the second
clock is required or not.
