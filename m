I don't still understand why you think this patch is wrong.
I think this is the best way not to think for all the driver developers
about other things than their business logic.

This does not hurt anyone and I think this is good enough.

If you want to provide another layer between master device and system mmu
as you mentioned, you do that. This patch does not restrict it.
