We check the status first to avoid any sleep()/schedule() in the case,
that the CPU is slower than I2C transaction.
Remember, this loop only happens after the event_wait loop has been
woken up by the i2c irq.
Since you are talking about hitting a tiny window of time at some
arbitrary point after an irq, the CPU time to this point & I2C
finishing would have to be very precisely aligned for the 1-2 loops
(at CPU clock rate) to matter.
