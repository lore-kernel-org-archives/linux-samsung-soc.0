HW configuration is dependent upon the parameters passed, which are not part
of alloc_chan_resources(). Consider it as kind of open() to get a handle for
dmaengine

There are few things we need to do for making APIs cleaner.

We have a mini discussion during KS/Plumbers, Here are the notes
http://www.spinics.net/lists/dmaengine/msg11570.html

I don't want to block your series for this, I will take a look at v8, first
thing in morning..

Thanks
