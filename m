I'm not really sure if displaying clock speed is really a good 
justification for increasing the list of system clocks almost by a factor 
of three. This will make clock lookup a bit heavy.

You might display speed of several most important clocks directly from the 
samsung clk driver using internal data, without the need of involving 
generic clock lookup for this purpose.

I believe that the intention was for it to work on non-DT platforms as 
well. However I might have misunderstood your suggestion, could you 
elaborate?

I'm definitely for indexed lookup. With the ability to define constants in 
device tree sources the main drawback of this solution being less readable 
now disappeared and everything left are advantages.

If it's about readability I tend to disagree. I find device tree much more 
readable as a way of describing hardware than hardcoded data structures, 
often using complex macros to keep the definitions short.

Using the approach with indexed clocks inside a single provider would allow 
to reuse the same internal SoC-specific data for both DT and non-DT 
variants, without any data duplication. This is definitely an advantage.

Yes, as I said, I'm definitely for the single clock provider approach (aka 
imx-like approach).
