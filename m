Isn't this material for the v4.3 -rc cycle since it's fixing a bug
(CPUs not booting)? So I don't think that's necessary to wait for v4.4.

But I was expecting another re-spin as from Abhilash's latest comments [0],
it seems the same workaround is needed in arch/arm/mach-exynos/platsmp.c
to avoid the CPU's not booting issue when CCI is disabled in DT and the
MCPM backend is bypassed.

Although I guess that could be also made as a follow up patch.
