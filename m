Hi Doug,
Thanks for looking into this series.

Yes, "drive" phase shift are there to meet hold time requirements. And
that why we in general don't change it as those are fixed for a
SoC/Board based on actual measurement of the same.

Thanks, suggestions/comments are welcome.

That is something nice to have, and should be done at some point.
As you know exynos implements a custom register called CLKSEL, and it
allows us to set the required "sample" phase shift. And exynos uses
"variable delay tuning" as per DW databook to set "sample" phase shift
based on tuning data.

yes the major concern in this series is probably this, which breaks
things unless everything merge in one go and via one tree. Thats why I
re-based everything including dts change on mmc-tree for this case and
added device-tree mailing list for more opinion etc.
