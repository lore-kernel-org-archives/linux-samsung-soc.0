I'm perfectly prepared to believe that there's poorly designed hardware
out there (either due to just poor design or deploying a controller in
an inappropriate application) that requires us to do things in software;
it's just relatively unusual as users tend to run into issues which
either can't be resolved or are excessively painful to resolve.
