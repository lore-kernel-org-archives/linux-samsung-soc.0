It seems fine to me to have this functionality in a separate function, 
it's self-contained and it's now pretty well documented.

We talked a little about this issue with Lukasz in person and it looks
like there are some DMC related registers in the clock controller register 
region, I'd say those registers are better handled by the DMC driver rather
than the clocks controller driver. Moreover, we should avoid abusing clk API
for not strictly clocks related functionality as it appears to be above.
It might be more appropriate to add in the dmc DT node a phandle to a regmap
exposed by the clock-controller node. It seems there will be even no single
register that would be shared between the DMC and the clock controller.
