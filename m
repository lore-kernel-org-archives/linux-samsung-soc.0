You are absolutely correct, for some reason I thought that the CLK_ARM_CLK
and CLK_KFC_CLK clocks were already defined in the cpu0 and cpu4 nodes from
exynos5420.dtsi and commit df09df6f9ac3 ("ARM: dts: add exynos5422-cpus.dtsi
to correct cpu order") missed that when reversing the cores for Exynos5422.

But on a second look to patch 3/8, I see that the clocks are defined in that
patch so I agree that $SUBJECT should just be squashed with 3/8 without doing
any split. Sorry for the noise.
