True if it isn't sparsemem. =

But look at pfn_valid in sparsemem. =


It just checks that there is a section and section_mem_map has SECTION_HAS_=
MEM_MAP.
The first section in above case has just 80M memory but section has 256M. =

So, 0x25000000 - 28000000 is the hole. If you pass pfn whihc is 0x2500000,
let's see pfn_valid. =


1. We pass pfn_to_section_nr check =

2. Both __nr_to_section and valid_section is vaild.

static inline int pfn_valid(unsigned long pfn) =

{
        if (pfn_to_section_nr(pfn) >=3D NR_MEM_SECTIONS)
                return 0;
        return valid_section(__nr_to_section(pfn_to_section_nr(pfn)));
}


What prevent above hole's case?
I think at least pfn_valid in sparsemem need bank range check like pfn_vali=
d of ARM =

in FLATMEM.
