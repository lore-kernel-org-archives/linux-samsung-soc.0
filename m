The problem you mention existed before the patch. It was using sleeping
primitives (mutex) before adding regmap so I understand you don't have
anything against this patch, right?

I can fix the issue but it will be a little bit trickier because I don't
have the hardware. Other guys in the team tested the patchset for me so
I rely on them in that matter. Anyway I'll work on it.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
