Yes I will try to improve my self to the point commit message
and code as per the documentation.

Let me clear my thoughts on clk's turned on for by driver.
Please correct me If I am wrong.

Exynos support Power domain to control the dynamic power consumption via clk.
Operating voltage
Operating frequency
Toggling ratios of the logic gate

PMU generates power control signal to regulator or PMIC.

To reduce the dynamic power consumption, Exynos SCP uses clock gating
and frequency scaling.

Exynos process support tmu power domain
Power Domain         Power Source         Internal Power Gating Method
           Included Modules

TEMP                     VDD18_TEMP        None
                       TEMP SENSOR

Exynos TMU is directly co-related to CPU frequency scaling module.
as their is increase in CPU clk speed with increase in temperature
TMU will control the flow of cpu speed via clk freq scaling.

It might be a good option to implement pm_runtime for tmu driver.

If you are not satisfied with this series of change lets drop them.
I will just re-submit err-clean up and e-Fuse changes.

Best Regards
-Anand
