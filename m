Sure. Thank you very much for testing.

I did build test with the ARMv7 for all patches and testing on actual 
platform with Jetson-TX1 platform + max77620 which have similar change 
with bind/unbind. This is what I learn from you for testing the remove 
callback/unbinding without making =m on RTC patches and this really 
helps me on my lots of testing.
