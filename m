You can't call pm_runtime_get() in the DRM core for that exact reason, but you 
can call it in a driver's implementation of .atomic_commit_tail(), which was 
my proposal. The .atomic_commit_tail() handler would then become something 
like

{
	for_each_ip_affected(ip, ...)
		pm_runtime_get_sync(ip);

	drm_atomic_helper_commit_tail(...);

	for_each_ip_affected(ip, ...)
		pm_runtime_put(ip);
}

You won't, because you also call pm_runtime_get() in the CRTC .enable() 
handler.

One good way to test this is to implement support for CRC calculation if your 
hardware supports it.
