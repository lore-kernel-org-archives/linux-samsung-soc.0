It is not enough to just check the voltage level and frequency.
Consider this example, host has capability to support
MMC_CAP_MAX_CURRENT_400, the PWR_CL_DDR_52_360 has the value 9 (400mA)
and PWR_CL_200_360 has the value 14 (800mA). Then even though the host
might be capable to run 200MHz clock and 3.6V, it can only enable DDR
at 52MHz and set 9 in POWER_CLASS.

I think, in mmc_select_powerclass, we need to loop through the power
classes of all supported modes of transfer (HS200, DDR52, ... ) and
choose the mode which gives maximum bandwidth but falls within host
capability of current consumption. Then set this to POWER_CLASS byte
and also use the same information when setting HS_TIMING in
mmc_init_card.
