Yes, keeping both make most sense, I think.

Anyway, I found now the original report thread of Masahiro and I see
Mark's response about using '-'. In that case I am fine with this. I
would prefer to take only the exynos part (separated to ARMv7 and
ARMv8) through my tree but I already sent a pull request so I am fine
with this going directly to arm-soc.

I think you need to update also:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/cpufreq/ti-cpufreq.txt
With that change:

(and implied acked-by)

Best regards,
Krzysztof
