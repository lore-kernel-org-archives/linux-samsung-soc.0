For example. Also I just noticed some previous comment by Krzysztof that
pointed that out already.

My suggestion: One sentence describing that the current situation is.
Another sentence explaining why this is bad/undesirable. Last sentence
saying what you're doing to fix this (can sometimes be omitted if it's
clear from the diffstat). In this case, the output of the checkpatch
script would come in handy.

With this, you avoid cramming every information into one long and
complicated sentence.

With best wishes,
Tobias
