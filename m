async-tx-api is not the DMA slave API.

DMA slave users do not call this function.  This documentation is not
relevant for DMA slave.

It doesn't say when.

It isn't.  DMA slave engine implementations have been needing the
issue_pending() call since their dawn, so it's something that they've
always needed.

That may be, and yes, it _might_ be worth discussing whether this should
be relaxed or not, but that should be done as a proposal, not trying to
hide it as a bug fix.  It isn't.
