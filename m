Yes, I've been looking at the docs again and found out a couple of things:

* Each GC_STATUSx register bit is associated with an IP hw block
* Some LPI_MASKx registers maps exactly with the GC_STATUSx (i.e: 0 and 1)
  and others maps only partially (i.e: LPI_MASK2 and GC_STATUS2)

So it is related to LPI as you said and both LPI_MASKx and GC_STATUSx are
part of the PMU register address space.

In the particular case of aclk266_g2d, the doc says that the clock can only
be gated when CG_STATUS0[20] and CG_STATUS0[21] are 0. These are associated
with the SSS and SSS_SLIM respectively which AFAIU are crypto h/w modules.

Indeed, we should really understand what the status on these registers
means. Also is not clear from the docs how much time should be waited,
how long until giving up, etc.

Having a clock driver to both a provider and consumer feels hacky to me as
well but I didn't find a better way to solve this issue... another option
is to have this workaround to solve the S2R issue while we figure out what
the the state in the CG_STATUSx really mean.

Perfect, I just asked since it was not clear to me from Abhilash comment.
But I also agree to only focus on the clock that is causing issues now.

Best regards,
