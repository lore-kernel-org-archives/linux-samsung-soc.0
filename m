I tend to disagree. The chance of a new Cortex A9 based SoC with
different implementor code showing up is so close to zero that I don't
see increasing of code complexity by adding yet another check justified.

That might be actually a better option. Something like

	if (read_cpuid_impl_and_part() == ARM_CPU(impl, part))

or even

	if (ARM_CPU_IS(impl, part))

would keep the checks simple, while still checking both values.

Current version of code, yes. However it handles only Exynos-based
boards running in secure mode. For those running in non-secure mode,
mainline does not support sleep yet.

I already have patches to change this, which I was planning to post
after eliminating last issue. The change set includes making this
save/restore being executed only in secure mode.

In ideal world (which I would be glad to be living in)...

We both know that we can't fully rely on firmware. Firmware bugs are
common and in many cases we can't do anything about it, because it
already comes with the device and in many cases it is undesirable to
change it or it can't be done at all.

Your point. Thanks for explaining this. However this will be still
running with just one CPU online.

This code is used by both system-wide suspend/resume and cpuidle paths.
Daniel has moved this code to CPU PM notifier as a part of his Exynos
cpuidle consolidation series to avoid code duplication, as this is the
common point of both paths.

To clarify, on suspend/resume path, the notifier is being called from
syscore_ops registered in kernel/cpu_pm.c, while on cpuidle path, this
is invoked from exynos_enter_core0_aftr() in
drivers/cpuidle/cpuidle-exynos.c, which calls cpu_pm_enter().
