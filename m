To summarize, using reg value pairs in DT makes sense if the amount
of data is huge. Otherwise we'll be describing indidual hardware bits
as properties in DT, or have to have huge amounts of static data in
the kernel.

Where it does not make sense is if there's a sequence of reads
and writes with test loops in between.. But that's does not look
to be the case here.

The reg value pairs will be readable when the DT preprocessing is
available, and that allows the values to be orred together while
DT properties don't. The alternative is to describe hardware register
bits as DT properties, which is very bloated.

But considering all this.. Are the samsung,reg-names really needed
by the kernel?

The pinctrl named modes actually are more generic from the pinctrl
client driver point of view as you can set up multiple states for
runtime PM.

Hey finally! That's good news.
