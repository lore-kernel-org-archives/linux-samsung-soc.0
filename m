OK, let's just use a common clk Kconfig symbol for Exynos ARM64.

What I tried to say is that with addition of support for few more
of those SoCs the kernel image size can easily grow by 1MB order,
due to just clk drivers inclusion. Perhaps it's not a big issue
with current hardware configuration.
Maybe in long term we should think about splitting CMU drivers
into a built-in critical clocks part and the rest in loadable
modules.
