Yes. If I recall correctly he has following main concerns:
1: To convert exynos-pmu to a proper platform driver before moving out 
of arch/arm/mach-exynos. This is already addressed.

2: Do we really need common driver for both ARM and ARM64? I feel yes, 
as at least I can see that driver's basic structure will be reused. As 
in case of PMU driver most of lines of code is data part (register 
offset and its values in different mode), that part will be kept in 
separate file e.g. exynos7-pmu.c or exynosXXXX-pmu.c.
There has been already one attempt of submission for exynos7 PMU driver at:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2014-November/305418.html

3: He had a concern that in case of ARM64 build most of ARM related code 
will be present in binary which will be dead code, that can be addressed 
by excluding ARM based SoC exynosXXXX-pmu.c file in Makefile.
It has been taken care in v3 7/7 patch in drivers/soc/samsung/Makefile.

Thanks. This was a review comment from Kukjin, to separate data part of 
all SoC and move them to respective files, same as we do for clock files 
of each SoC.

It will reduce in duplication driver structure, which will be same.
