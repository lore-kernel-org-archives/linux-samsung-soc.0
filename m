Sounds like you are dealing with crappy documentation :-(

No. I'm just trying to understand how things work so that we can arrive
to the right decision. I know what it is like to try and quickly unblock
everyone else and the rush to do so often leads to less awesome
solutions.

Anyways, getting back on point, Tomasz was right about the whole clk_get
thing. So I'm happy to take either V1 or V3 of your patch. I will be
submitting a second PR for 3.16 next week and it will include whichever
version you and Tomasz agree is best.

Regards,
Mike
