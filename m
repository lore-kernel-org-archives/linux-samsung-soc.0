According to datasheet, the S2MPS13X and S2MPS14X should update write
buffer via setting WUDR bit to high after ctrl register is written.

If not, ALARM interrupt of rtc-s5m doesn't happen first time when i use
tools/testing/selftests/timers/rtctest.c test program and hour format is
used to 12 hour mode in Odroid-XU3 board.

One more issue is the RTC doesn't keep time on Odroid-XU3 board when i
turn on board after power off even if RTC battery is connected. It can
be solved as setting WUDR & RUDR bits to high at the same time after
RTC_CTRL register is written. It's same with condition of only writing
ALARM registers, so this is for only S2MPS14 and we should set WUDR &
A_UDR bits to high on S2MPS13.

I can't find any reasonable description about this like fix from
datasheet, but can find similar codes from rtc driver source of
hardkernel kernel and vender kernel.
