Ok.

Not quite there yet. It is not possible to leave out cd-gpios for
"samsung,sdhci-cd-internal" since the current Samsung pinmux
configuration piggybacks on gpio dt binding. Can we use the following
instead.

none               -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-none"
broken-cd        -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-none"
cd-gpios          -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-gpios"
non-removable -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-permanent"
cd-gpios + samsung,sdhci-cd-internal -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-internal"

Thanks Chris.

Regards,
Thomas.
