Oh, right, the old driver was changing DIV_APLL, DIV_ATB and
DIV_PCLK_DBG as well. Somehow I was under an impression that we need to
care only about those dividers on the path after DIV_CORE and DIV_CORE2.
In this case the parent rate is the key here, although I'd call it "CPU
block parent rate (usually APLL)".

However this means that the trick with using DIV_CORE and DIV_CORE2 to
divide the rate of temporary parent clock is not enough, because DIV_ATB
is sourced directly from MOUT_CORE.

Well, they are not that generic as they might appear. I've seen
different values for the same SoC in different vendor kernels, depending
on device the kernel was targeted for. Also they will likely differ
between SoC revisions.

However it might be a good idea indeed to keep the table in the code as
a first step to get the driver running without creating new DT bindings.

By the way, I'm not fully convinced if there is really a need for such
hardcoded look-up tables at all. Those divisors certainly look like they
are calculated based on some upper bounds for certain clocks and the
driver could simply find them out itself if those limits were provided.

Best regards,
Tomasz
