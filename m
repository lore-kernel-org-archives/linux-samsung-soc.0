I remembered that I and Doug were discussed for this problem with exynos5420-peach board(?), right?
Is arndale-octa board the same circuit with peach?
If it's same, I think Doug's comment is right.
But if card-detect pis is used with other power, we don't need to consider the VDDQ_MMC2 power domain.
It needs more information and checks its schematic.
