I don't get why you have reverted the main feature of "Firmware-assisted 
suspend/resume
of Exynos SoCs" because of an issue on the completely independent 
patchset which adds
AFTR idle mode support. Could you please keep the "ARM: firmware: 
Introduce suspend
and resume operations" and "ARM: EXYNOS: Add support for firmware-assisted
suspend/resume" patches?

Best regards
