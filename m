Hi Nico,

Sorry, I can't stay away from this thread ;)

It makes lots of sense, though not from a software maintainability
perspective. It would be nice if everything still looked like ARM7TDMI
but in the race for performance (vs power), hardware becomes more
complex and it's not just the CPU but adjacent parts like interconnects,
caches, asynchronous bridges, voltage shifters, memory controllers,
clocks/PLLs etc. Many of these are simply hidden from the high level OS
like Linux because the OS assumes certain configuration (e.g. access to
memory) and it's only the hardware itself that knows in what order they
can be turned on or off (when triggered explicitly by the OS or an
external event). Having an dedicated power controller (e.g. M-class
processor) to handle some of these is a rather flexible approach, other
bits require RTL (and usually impossible to update).

I agree that things can go wrong (both in hardware and software, no
matter where it runs) but please don't think that such power
architecture has been specifically engineered to hide the hardware from
Linux. It's a necessity for complex systems and the optimal solution is
not always simplification (it's not just ARM+vendors doing this, just
look at the power model of modern x86 processors, hidden nicely from the
software behind a few registers while making things harder for scheduler
which cannot rely on a constant performance level; but it's a trade-off
they are happy to make).

That's the trade-off between software complexity and hardware cost,
gates, power consumption. You can do proper physical separation of the
secure services but this would require a separate CPU that is rarely
used and adds to the overall SoC cost. On large scale hardware
deployment, it's exactly economics that matter and these translate into
hardware cost. The software cost is irrelevant here, whether we like it
or not.
