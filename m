Great, I guess some time is needed until it shows up in the public
git tree.

Thanks, I've just sent an updated series. Would be good to finally
merge it if it looks OK. I have a few more patches on top of it but
that likely could be merged only in a week or two, after related
driver changes are finally reviewed and queued for 3.12.
