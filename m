I don't see any benefits of using complex interfaces over simply
initializing the pin to the right value once at boot-up or at
suspend/resume. As far as I understand Doug's explanation of the
problem, nothing else is expected from the OS with respect to this pin.
Moreover it doesn't affect operation of any drivers.

So I'm still for the simplest and effective solution, i.e. hogs.
