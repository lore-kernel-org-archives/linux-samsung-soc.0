...so looking at your "dts" file, it looks like this _isn't_ your
problem.  Your "vmmc" regulator is listed as "always on", so I believe
that you're OK.  Your regulator probably _shouldn't_ be "always on"
(it prevents power cycling the SD card) but right now it's good that
it is...

If any board has a "vmmc" that is not listed as always on then it
would regress with the first two patches applied (and without the
3rd), but there are none that I personally know of that do.
