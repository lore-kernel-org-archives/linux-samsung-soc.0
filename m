Thanks for working with opp-v2 bindings, really appreciate it.

But, before I start reviewing this series, I have few comments.
- We weren't able to use cpufreq-dt driver for big LITTLE platforms
  earlier, as it never had multi cluster support and we wanted
  clock-sharing information via DT.
- That is all fixed now.
- I want Samsung's big LITTLE platforms to use cpufreq-dt and drop
  arm_big_little driver completely.
- The only case for which it (arm_big_little) driver might be useful
  is the IKS solution. Which I don't believe you are going to use in
  future :)

My plan for the arm-big-little driver:
- Migrate all platforms to use cpufreq-dt instead for non-IKS
  solution
- Make arm-big-little driver arm-big-little-iks only driver.

@Sudeep: What would it take you to use cpufreq-dt for ARM's platforms
?
