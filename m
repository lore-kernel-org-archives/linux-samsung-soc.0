The clock names 'biu' and 'ciu' are derived from the terminology used
by the data sheet of the mshc controller. The 'biu' clock is the
source clock for the bus interface unit and 'ciu' clock is the clock
source for card interface unit of the controller. So these names are
generic and not specific to a platform. Passing clock names from
platform data is generally frowned upon.

Yes, the clk_disable will have to be preceded with a IS_ERR check. I
will fix this.

Ok, this also will be fixed.

This is wrong. It should not have been here. I will fix this. Thanks
for pointing this out.

Thanks,
Thomas.
