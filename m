It must do a whole lot more than that, otherwise we wouldn't be talking 
about ways to update it.

In other words, you are pleading guilty for bad design.

Usually, when the mechanism is there, it gets happily used even before 
mainline usage is considered.

Shit happens.  One line or two is tolerable.

What is not acceptable is the impossibility to fix fundamental 
correctness issues because people think their damn read-only firmware is 
bug free.  I've spent a great amount of time doing multiple rounds of 
reviews for MCPM backends.  Still it seems that people just don't get 
all the correctness subtleties before at least 5 rounds.  Yet they 
thought their code was OK on the initial rounds, otherwise why would 
they knowingly post buggy code?  If that code had been put into 
read-only firmware, say behind some PSCI interface for example, then 
your device would simply be stuck to board-bringup feature level.

I don't know enough about the actual issue with the Chromebook yet, but 
I do hope your firmware screwups aren't too serious.  The patch Doug 
just posted appears innocent enough.
