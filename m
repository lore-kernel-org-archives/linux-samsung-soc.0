Well, current design, or rather lack of thereof, has been established 
after a significant amount of discussion, mostly with ARM SoC and MFD 
maintainers.

It started from a simple reorganization of the clocksource driver to be 
multiplatform friendly, without any means of synchronizing both drivers 
other than local_irq_save() and _restore() that used to be there 
originally, before I started my work on this. This was enough to work 
correctly, because both drivers at the same time are used only on 
uniprocessor systems.

Here's the thread with patches:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/16664/focus=17267

Then I opened a Pandora's Box by asking for opinion in this thread:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/16480/focus=16500

After that I started working on a complex framework for sharing this IP 
block that would solve all the problems with synchronization, channel 
allocation, device tree parsing, variant management, etc.

Here's an initial version, which started as an MFD master driver, which 
would let 2 client drivers use the hardware (only the clocksource part was 
implemented in that series):
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/17464/focus=229250

Still, that version didn't receive too good feedback, with comments 
pointing me to change the architecture to master-slave, with the 
clocksource driver being the master and PWM driver being the slave. And so 
v5 was made:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/17864

This version was generally accepted, but then we discussed on IRC (mostly 
me and Arnd) whether such complex infrastructure is really needed and 
concluded that for this platform a simple shared spinlock would be enough, 
based on following reasons:
- on all SoCs on which the clocksource driver is going to be used there is 
only one instance of the PWM block, with 5 channels
- on all existing boards there are always at least two channels that don't 
have outputs
- operations on particular PWM channels must be synchronized anyway, 
because there are registers shared by all PWM channels (TCON being most 
important where enable, autoreload and invert bits are located for all 
channels).

And so we got to current design which is basically a shared spinlock and 
per-board output_mask, which specifies which channels have outputs on 
particular boards. If you look to the clocksource driver, you can see that 
it tries to allocate two output-less channels for timekeeping purposes and 
if it fails to do so, it simply panics.

IMHO this solution is fine, because it's simple, has little overhead and 
it just works in case of platforms for which it is needed.

Best regards,
Tomasz
