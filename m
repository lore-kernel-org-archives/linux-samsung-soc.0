There are no common solution ;), because CONFIG_PM_GENERIC_DOMAINS can be "n" too :)
and number of combinations of config options to handle will grow. Right?
What if voltage or clocks domains will be added?

So, everything is about the decision made for arch/platform/soc/driver
and such problems should be solved individually.

Look, once you'll add in core code smth. like in this series - the driver's
code will partially lose ability to control PM. This, in turn, may lead
to the fact that PM management for some drivers or even SoC will be impossible
to add (assume you know that HW engineers can do absolutely crazy things to
reach power savings targets).

Yep. ;) You've mixed a lot of things together in your comments (.
And if i understand right - first of all you are fixing the issue for the case
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y and, in my opinion, the root cause of such issues is 
exactly the usage of pm_runtime_set_active(), because it breaks
symmetry of Runtime PM.

As for me It much more simple to deal with well known limitation of Runtime PM:
"calling of driver's own ->runtime_resume() when pm_runtime_resume() called from probe"
and still benefit from all features provided by pm_runtime_get/put() than playing with pm_runtime_set_active() and:
- fixing unbalanced get/put calls (good example is http://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&m=141580289601886&w=2
  where unexpected (as for me) call of pm_runtime_get_noresume() is added in .remove() callback);
- fixing PD
- fixing enabling of parent devices (it will happen, believe me;).

What I'm saying is that it should work with pm_runtime_get_sync
for the case CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y ;) and It might be better to power on PD once the
first device is attached to it if CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=n and do this inside GPD code.
(^ it could even make your patch smaller)

+- 10% - I've calculated number of occurrences of pm_runtime_enable()  :)

Ok. Looks like we both still hold one's ground :) I give up (found at about ~70 
drivers which use set_active() in probe - and it's at about of 20% of all 
Runtime PM enabled drivers).

But could you, at least, consider my proposition to enable PD from
dev_pm_domain_attach/detach once first device is attached to it, pls?
