This series was first posted for 3.17 and you said that it was OK if
it gets merged through the MFD tree but you didn't ack the set so it
missed 3.17. The max77802 mfd driver dependency made it for 3.17 so
that's why I re-posted it for 3.18 about a month ago but got no
feedback so far...

Since we are in 3.17-rc4 already, I'm afraid that this series may miss
3.18 again. Other people show their interest in the series since it
has been reviewed and tested by many folks so it should be safe to
merge them. Is there anything else you need from me to pick the
series?

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
