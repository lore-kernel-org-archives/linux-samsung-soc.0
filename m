Yes, correct.

I think, that "LAB" name is with us for some time, so it would be a
pity to discard it.

This is correct. Also, the underlying SoC - Exynos4412 has 4 cores with
option to set frequency only on all of them.

My goal is to not touch the ondemand code. It has matured, so I would
like to leave it as it is.

This is also done - you get the LAB configuration specified in the DT
for the particular platform/board.

I'm not sure if I have understood you, but something like that is also
performed in the code.

As written above.

Discussion about above functionalities requires consulting the
implementation to be sure that our opinions are the same.
