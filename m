Looks like a proper workaround (at least till of_irq_init sets this flag
before calling irq_init_cb()) however I have some more doubts:

1. The commit 15cc2ed6dcf9 ("of/irq: Mark initialised interrupt
controllers as populated") might be also applied to clock CLK_OF_DECLARE
and the problem will appear again.

2. We are reusing PMU compatible for irqcip, clock provider and a
platform driver. This is one PMU block with many features thus many
drivers were created. What happens if the Exynos platform driver
(drivers/soc/samsung/exynos-pmu.c) binds before irqchip or clk provider?
Probably we should not reuse the compatible but create a new one for
each type of driver? How does it match DeviceTree?

Javier, Rob, any hints on that? Best practices, suggestions for future?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
