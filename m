I understood your reply.
But, Please consider the diskcipher isn't just for FMP. 
The UFS in Samsung SoC also has UFS ICE. This UFS ICE can be registered 
as an algorithm of diskcipher like FMP.

Following is my opinion to introduce diskcipher.
I think the common feature of ICE like FMP and UFS ICE, 
is 'exposing cipher text to storage".
And, Crypto test is also important for ICE.  Diskcipher supports
the common feature of ICE. 
I think specific functions for each ICE such as the key control of UFS ICE
and the writing crypto table of FMP can be processed at algorithm level.

Thanks for your reply.
Boojin Kim.
