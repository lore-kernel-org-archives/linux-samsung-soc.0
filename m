That's your opinion which I strongly disagree with.

Indeed, but... Cortex is an ARM Ltd trademark, so I really doubt that
we'll see a Cortex processor implemented by another party other than
ARM.  So, there's no need for ARM_CPU(impl, part).

As Will has already pointed out, writing to the diagnostic register
becomes a no-op in non-secure mode - it doesn't fault.  So moving
the saving and restoring of this register into generic code, where
other platforms already require it, makes total sense.

Of course, when you have to deal with it in non-secure mode, that's
something that you have to deal with, but in secure mode, platform
code should not have to worry about this level of detail.

Yes, I'm aware of the crap situation there.  That doesn't stop us
talking about these aspects though and setting what we expect in the
future - and changing the code to a better structure.

... which then goes on to call cpu_suspend().  So moving this stuff
into the CPU level makes total sense rather than having every platform
running in secure mode duplicating this functionality.  Thanks for
pointing that out and adding further justification to my assertion.
