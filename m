I don't think anyone is arguing that the policy should not be in the OS.
But part of the mechanism can be in the OS and part in firmware, SCP or
hardware. The kernel part can be a simple PSCI call or more complex
setup (possibly MCPM-based) which usually ends up with a WFI. This WFI,
however, triggers further hardware changes which may be handled by
dedicated power controller.

Yes, we can treat it as firmware, but we don't have a better alternative
to move the functionality into the kernel (well, we could at least allow
the kernel to load a binary blob and restart the controller).

But even this is a complex problem. Anyway, I don't think the (ARM at
least) hardware guys aim to take over the cpufreq or Linux scheduler
functionality. Their concern is rather mechanism rather than policy.

Indeed. But that's not the aim of the power controller on our boards.
It's just a mechanism for safely changing sleep states, CPU frequencies
but entirely under the OS decision.

I'm definitely not suggesting ARM is going the same route. Just trying
to show that ARM is slightly better here.

As a personal opinion, I like the simplicity of writing a register to
change the P-state but I don't like the non-determinism of the x86
hardware w.r.t. CPU performance. There are however some "policy" aspects
which I find interesting (like detecting whether the workload is memory
bound and automatically lowering the CPU frequency; the OS cannot react
this fast).

I fully agree (and I think Linaro is well positioned for this ;),
possibly as an extension of the boot+firmware architecture).
