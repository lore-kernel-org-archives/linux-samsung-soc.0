A hybrid solution came to my mind, define bank types in device tree once 
and then reference them in banks. Something like:

	pinctrl-bank-types {
		bank_off: bank-off {
			samsung,func-width = <4>;
			samsung,pud-width = <2>;
			samsung,drv-width = <2>;
			samsung,conpdn-width = <2>;
			samsung,pudpdn-width = <2>;
		};

		bank_alive: bank-alive {
			samsung,func-width = <4>;
			samsung,pud-width = <2>;
			samsung,drv-width = <2>;
		};
	};

	/* ... */

	pinctrl@12345678 {
		/* ... */
		gpa0: gpa0 {
			/* ... */
			samsung,bank-type = <&bank_off>;
			/* ... */
		};
		/* ... */
	};

This would add the possibility to define new banks types quickly, but would 
not add too much overhead.

What do you think?

All the definitions in device tree for pinctrl take lots of lines and so I 
though it would make it more readable if pin groups would have its own 
source file and so would pin banks.

Now that I think of it, they aren't going to be modified too much, so it 
might be better indeed to put them together in a single file.
