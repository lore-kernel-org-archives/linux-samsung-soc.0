Looking at Figure 11-3 in 11.3.2 Basic Timer Operation chapter of Exynos
4412 public datasheet [1] (page 659), the calculation above seems
correct. The default state of timer output is high and if TCMP is set to
a value higher than TCNT, then it will never toggle to low.

According to my computations, with tcmp=0 you should get exactly the
minimum supported duty cycle (1 / N, where N is the number of ticks of
period), not full brightness. Are you sure that you have the right
output polarity configured?

Comparing few datasheets, the timers seem identical in this aspect.
