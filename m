Thomas,

Since I commented on previous versions of this patch, I would have
loved to have been CCed on this new version.  ;)

This patch applies fine but fails to compile on linux-next
"next-20130408".  You lost the race with:
   f2f942c mmc: dw_mmc: Check return value of regulator_enable

...that patch adds a "goto err_setup_bus" and you've renamed that
label.  I guess you get another fun rebase.

NOTE: this patch is even more urgent than it was before.  It looks
like pincontrol stuff has now landed in linux-next which means that
Exynos5 devices that need eMMC/SD will no longer boot until this patch
goes in.

-Doug
