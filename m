Good point.  Hopefully someone at Samsung can work on removing the
board itself?  If you'd like me to take this on then let me know and I
can put it on my list.

I'm happy to resubmit my patch under ARCH_EXYNOS5.  I'll move the
exynos4 one at the same time.

I'm going to make the assumption that PINCTRL_EXYNOS and
PINCTRL_EXYNOS5440 can happily coexist.  Certainly I've got both
defined in my tree right now and nothing blows up.  I haven't tested
on 5440 but things ought to be handled by "compatible" checks, right?

I'll also assume that eventually someone will move PINCTRL_EXYNOS5440
into PINCTRL_EXYNOS.  If PINCTRL_EXYNOS5440 won't eventually move
under PINCTRL_EXYNOS then it makes less sense to define PINCTRL_EXYNOS
for all exynos parts.
