I didn't quite get this. What do you mean by "if we defer..."?

Defer into *what* and defer of *what*?  Could you please elaborate.

You may be right.

Although, I don't know of other examples, besides the runtime PM use
case, where non-atomic channel prepare/unprepare would make sense. Do
you?

Adding/re-designing dma APIs is a viable option to solve the runtime PM case.

Changes would be needed for all related dma client drivers as well,
although if that's what we need to do - let's do it.

Yes, it can and this works from runtime PM point of view. But the
following issues would remain unsolved.

1)
Dependencies between dma drivers and dma client drivers during system
PM. For example, a dma client driver needs the dma controller to be
operational (remain system resumed), until the dma client driver
itself becomes system suspended.

The *only* currently available solution for this, is to try to system
suspend the dma controller later than the dma client, via using the
*late or the *noirq system PM callbacks. This works for most cases,
but it becomes a problem when the dma client also needs to be system
suspended at the *late or the *noirq phase. Clearly this solution that
doesn't scale.

Using device links explicitly solves this problem as it allows to
specify this dependency between devices.

2)
We won't avoid dma clients from getting -EPROBE_DEFER when requesting
their dma channels in their ->probe() routines. This would be
possible, if we can set up the device links at device initialization.
