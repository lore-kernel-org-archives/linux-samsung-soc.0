Dear Anand and Tobias,

To Anand,
=46irst of all, thanks to your test on previous patchset.
I removed the your tested-by tag from this version
because I modified the devfreq core using DEVFREQ_TRANSITION_NOTIFIER n=
otifier.
I think that this patch-set need to test with this patchset.
If you possible, could you please test this patch-set? Thanks in advanc=
e.

To Tobias,
I fixed the following issues reported by you. Thanks your test and repo=
rt.
- RCU locking issue
- debugfs error during kernel booting

Best Regards,
Chanwoo Choi
