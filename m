It's a bad idea to make platform data be run-time discardable like this=
:

What you end up with is some platform data structures which must be kep=
t
(those which have pointers to them from the platform data), and others
(the platform data itself) which can be discarded at runtime.

We know that the __initdata attributations cause lots of problems -
they're frequently wrong.  Just see the constant hastle with __devinit
et.al.  The same issue happens with __initdata as well.

So why make things more complicated by allowing some platform data
structures to be discardable and others not to be?  Is their small
size (maybe 6 words for this one) really worth the hastle of getting
__initdata attributations wrong (eg, on the keymap data?)
