I think that exynos5433-tm2-common.dtsi is not necessary because there
is small difference between TM2 and TM2E.

I explain the detailed difference between TM2 and TM2E and then reply
how to support the TM2E board with existing exynos5433-tm2.dts file
without exynos5433-tm2-common.dtsi.

Difference and the way to support TM2E with existing
exynos5433-tm2.dts file as following:
- hsi2c_9 is either used or not. TM2 uses the hsi2c_9 node for
touchkey. but TM2E do not use the hsi2c_9.
   : We can just disable the hsi2c_9 node on tm2e.dts as following:

   &hsi2c_9 {
         status = "disable";
   };

- The difference name and voltage of regulators.
   : Already modified on tm2e.dts.
- The size of touchscreen between tm2 and tm2e ('x-size', 'y-size')
   : We can update the x/y size on tm2e.dts.
- The timing value of display-timing between tm2 and tm2e
('clock-frequency', 'hactive')
   : We can update the 'clock-frequency' and 'hactive'  on tm2e.dts.
