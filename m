Yes, I know too little about DT to figure out how these should
come in.

Yes, that's a solid case!

I love it.

I'm not following, but I guess I will understand when I see the
patches. The idea behind the current map concept is that you
get either a string or struct device * to identify the pin controller
and mapped device, that's as far as I thought it out, sorry for
any inherent limitations, they're not intentional...

Thanks,
