This patchset factors out duplicated code associated with parsing PCI
DT "ranges" properties across the architectures and introduces a
"ranges" parser. This parser "of_pci_range_parser" can be used directly
by ARM host bridge drivers enabling them to obtain ranges from device
trees.

I've included the Reviewed-by and Tested-by's received from v5/v6 in this
patchset, earlier versions of this patchset (v3) have been tested-by:

Thierry Reding <thierry.reding-RM9K5IK7kjKj5M59NBduVrNAH6kLmebB@public.gmane.org>
Jingoo Han <jg1.han-Sze3O3UU22JBDgjK7y7TUQ@public.gmane.org>

I've tested that this patchset builds and runs on ARM and that it builds on
PowerPC and x86_64.

Compared to the v6 sent by Andrew Murray, the following changes have
been made in response to build errors/warnings:

 * Inclusion of linux/of_address.h in of_pci.c as suggested by Michal
   Simek to prevent compilation failures on Microblaze (and others) and his
   ack.

 * Use of externs, static inlines and a typo in linux/of_address.h in response
   to linker errors (multiple defination) on x86_64 as spotted by a kbuild test
   robot on (jcooper/linux.git mvebu/drivers)

 * Add EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL to of_pci_range_parser function to be consistent
   with of_pci_process_ranges function

Compared to the v5 sent by Andrew Murray, the following changes have
been made:

 * Use of CONFIG_64BIT instead of CONFIG_[a32bitarch] as suggested by
   Rob Herring in drivers/of/of_pci.c

 * Added forward declaration of struct pci_controller in linux/of_pci.h
   to prevent compiler warning as suggested by Thomas Petazzoni

 * Improved error checking (!range check), removal of unnecessary be32_to_cpup
   call, improved formatting of struct of_pci_range_parser layout and
   replacement of macro with a static inline. All suggested by Rob Herring.

Compared to the v4 (incorrectly labelled v3) sent by Andrew Murray,
the following changes have been made:

 * Split the patch as suggested by Rob Herring

Compared to the v3 sent by Andrew Murray, the following changes have
been made:

 * Unify and move duplicate pci_process_bridge_OF_ranges functions to
   drivers/of/of_pci.c as suggested by Rob Herring

 * Fix potential build errors with Microblaze/MIPS

Compared to "[PATCH v5 01/17] of/pci: Provide support for parsing PCI DT
ranges property", the following changes have been made:

 * Correct use of IORESOURCE_* as suggested by Russell King

 * Improved interface and naming as suggested by Thierry Reding

Compared to the v2 sent by Andrew Murray, Thomas Petazzoni did:

 * Add a memset() on the struct of_pci_range_iter when starting the
   for loop in for_each_pci_range(). Otherwise, with an uninitialized
   of_pci_range_iter, of_pci_process_ranges() may crash.

 * Add parenthesis around 'res', 'np' and 'iter' in the
   for_each_of_pci_range macro definitions. Otherwise, passing
   something like &foobar as 'res' didn't work.

 * Rebased on top of 3.9-rc2, which required fixing a few conflicts in
   the Microblaze code.

v2:
  This follows on from suggestions made by Grant Likely
  (marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=136079602806328)
