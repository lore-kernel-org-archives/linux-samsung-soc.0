The child nodes would be direct child nodes.

Thanks for suggesting this alternate method. I do agree with your
point. But, for now, I would prefer to stabilize this driver without
changing the dt parsing code and make it usable for client nodes. I
will revisit your suggested approach at a later point. I assume for
now that the author's of client nodes know which pin settings to
select.

The alias is required since the SoC data for a particular instance is
dependent on the instance number. And the instance number is derived
from the alias.

Ok. Thanks Stephen for your comments on this patch.
