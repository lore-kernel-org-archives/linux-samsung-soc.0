I'm not sure I totally understood what you said.  In my manual I have
a table titled "Table 2-1 Exynos 5420 Pin List".  Look in this table
for XMMC2CDN and XMMC2DATA_0.  Look to the right of the table and
you'll see the power domain.  For both it shows VDDQ_MMC2.  If that
doesn't mean that the two are in the same voltage domain then I don't
know what does.  Can you point to any examples where they have
different voltage domains?

I agree that what exynos does is not sensible, but that's what it is.

The dw_mmc controller has a way to read the card detect, right?
That's internal to the controller.  The alternative would be to use a
generic GPIO for card detect.
