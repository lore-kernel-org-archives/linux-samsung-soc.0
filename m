You can create a new compatible string (e.g. "samsung,exynos-armv8") for 
ARMv8 Exynos if support for one in mainline shows up and/or simply use 
another name for ARMv7 Exynos (e.g. "samsung,exynos-armv7").

There is no board specific stuff in mach-exynos/ with DT, so there is no 
need to keep those file separate, especially when stuff from common.c is 
constantly being (re)moved.

Also I'd rather stick to what other platforms use, which would be 
exynos.c (like tegra.c), as Arnd proposed.
