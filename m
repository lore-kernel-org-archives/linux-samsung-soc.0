I'm very surprised by this.  Clock changes using clock notifiers in
Thomas' original patchset were Acked by you:

"[PATCH v12 1/6] clk: samsung: add infrastructure to register cpu clocks"
https://www.marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=141657613203808&w=2

I've only fixed issues present within the original code (this 4 lines
workaround/hack change to clock subsystem is a result of this), I have
not changed it fundamentally.

So after 2.5 months of waiting on your feedback you're saying that the
current patches (Acked by all other Maintainers and tested on affected
platforms) should be just abandoned and we should wait with re-doing
them on some not yet implemented feature of clock subsystem which would
be available 2 months from now (at earliest)?

Also what should I do about CPUfreq support for SoCs that don't have
platform specific CPUfreq drivers currently and that need current patches
to work (I mean Exynos542x, Exynos5800 and Exynos5433 in the future)?
