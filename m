I'd rather you use the implications described above for the names
described above; there's not much point in defining named behaviors
across the subsystem if they're actually different in each driver.

But I think you can still use driver-internal properties that change the
interpretation of those names in a documented way.  If the meaning of
cd-gpios is modified when coupled with your "samsung,sdhci-cd-external",
that's okay with me.  That should cover all the cases you need until you
migrate to using pinctrl, right?  So, you could immediately support:

none          -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-internal"
broken-cd     -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-none"
cd-gpios      -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-gpios"
non-removable -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-permanent"
cd-gpios + samsung,sdhci-cd-external -> currently "samsung,sdhci-cd-external"

How does that sound?

Thanks,

- Chris.
