Urgh!!! Let's see how we can work this out. I will be helping out and
give this the highest prio!

I did post a patchset for exynos 5 media gsc driver, I guess you have
seen it!? Now, that doesn't help us much but still.

This version is superseded by a v3. That takes a more solid approach
on how to power on the PM domain from the bus' ->probe(). It's being
discussed currently.

[PATCH v3 0/9] PM / Domains: Fix race conditions during boot

You should be on cc-list of that.

That was a limitation which is fixed in v3. I have tested loading
modules and it works nicely.

That's a very good question! I think the assumption is wrong!

Somehow we need to decouple that dependency. To me, typically the
"need_restore" flag should reflect the current runtime PM status of
the device, which isn't the case right now.

In the v3 version of this patchset, the PM domain will be powered on
from the bus's ->probe(), which also means the "need_restore" flag
will initially always be set to "false" once the device are being
probed by the driver.

That means, those drivers not invoking pm_runtime_set_active() and
manually enable clk/resources during ->probe(), but instead relies on
pm_runtime_get_sync() - will _not_ work. As you stated above for some
of the Exynos drivers.

Even if it's likely that most of these Exynos drivers should be using
pm_runtime_set_active() during ->probe(), the key-problem lies in
genpd's wrong assumption about the device's runtime PM status, which
is stored in the "need restore" flag.

If we would fix the issue in genpd for the need_restore flag, that
should solve the regression for Exynos, don't you think?

I will immediately start working on a patch on genpd, which tries this
approach, I will keep you posted.

As stated, I fully agree!
