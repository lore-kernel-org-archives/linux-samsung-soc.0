It is invalid to check just the part number.  The part number on its
own is meaningless without taking account of the implementor.  Both
the implementor and the part number should be checked at each of these
sites.

Another point: exynos have taken it upon themselves to add code which
saves various ARM core registers.  This is a bad idea, it brings us
back to the days where every platform did their own suspend implementations.

CPU level registers should be handled by CPU level code, not by platform
code.  Is there a reason why this can't be added to the Cortex-A9
support code in proc-v7.S ?

And presumably with the CPU level code dealing with those registers,
you don't need the calls to save and restore these registers in this
notifier.

Which, by the way, is probably illegal to run as it runs in a read-
lock code path and with the SCU disabled.  As you're calling
scu_enable() that means you're non-coherent with the other CPUs,
and therefore locks don't work.

I think this code is very broken and wrongly architected, and shows
that we're continuing to make the same mistakes that we made all
through the 2000s with platforms doing their own crap rather than
properly thinking about this stuff.
