This is second attemp for making in this series. This is a collection of patches
already reviewed and merged in maintainer's tree, but could not make it thorugh main linus tree,
due to last moment suggestion of proper location of driver should be
"drivers/memory" instead of "drivers/soc". I have rebased all the patches
and moved into "drivers/memory/samsung". Second time due to some suggestions in binding document.

As this is just a movement without changing actual driver code,
I have not removed "Reviewed-By", "Tested-By" or "Acked-By".

To make sure everything is fine, I have again tested it on Exynos5880 based
Chromebook for normal boot, S2R functionality and its working fine.

This series has been prepared on top of next-soc branch of Krzysztof's tree.

Changes since RESPIN-v1:
 - Addressed review comments in srom binding documentation mainly from Rob Herring.
 - Modified compatibility from "samsung, exynos-srom" to "samsung, exynos4210-srom"
 - Changed type of optional property "samsung,srom-page-mode" from int to bool
 - Adjusted exynos-srom driver code for reflecting change in type of above property.
 - Renamed exynos SROM dt node as "memory-controller" instead of "sromc".
