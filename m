OK no problem.  That's easy enough.  I added them to play it safe as a 
test patch in case some VFP content could be lost somehow by looping 
back through the CPU init code for example, and needed to be saved.

Well... Maybe it wasn't designed for that, but it certainly can be used 
for that. And with no modifications to the core code, making this 
solution fairly elegant.  This is not so different from, say, the BPF 
code being reused for seccomp_filters. BPF wasn't designed for system 
call filtering, but it happens to work well.

One could certainly question the need for so many controls handled in 
secure world.  But that is not the point.

Here we're talking about MCPM.  That implies the kernel has control over 
SCTLR.SMP and the CCI.  If those things aren't under the kernel's 
control, then MCPM is of no use to you.

Therefore, if you do want to use MCPM, then this implies the kernel has 
access to the CCI. And if it has access to it, then it should turn it on 
by itself in all cases to be consistent, not only in half of the cases.

> 2) (1) must be documented.

Absolutely.  But let's be coherent in the implementation so the 
documentation is as simple as it can be.

I disagree.  This can perfectly be turned into driver code. If we need 
it too early for existing kernel device framework to handle this 
properly, then the solution is to extend the existing framework or 
create another one specially for that purpose.  This may not be obvious 
when TC2 is the first/only platform in that situation, but if more 
platforms have the same need then it'll be easier to abstract 
commonalities into a framework.

Saying that no framework exists today or/and upstream maintainers are 
being difficult is _not_ a reason for throwing your hands up and e.g. 
shoving all this code into firmware instead.

That's where the disconnect lies.  On the one hand you say "I understand 
they are tricky, I understand they take lots of time to implement them 
and to debug them" and on the other hand you say "They might end up being 
implemented in HW in the not so far future."  That simply makes no 
economical sense at all!

When some operation is 1) tricky and takes time to debug, and 2) not 
performance critical (no one is trying to get in and out of idle or 
hibernation a billion times per second), then you should never ever put 
such a thing in firmware, and hardware should be completely out of the 
question!

If they HAVE to run in secure world then your secure world architecture 
is simply misdesigned, period.  Someone must have ignored the economics 
of modern software development to have come up with this.

OK. Let's start by agreeing on the spirit behind my patch then.  The 
actual patch implementation details are a secondary concern and open for 
discussion.
