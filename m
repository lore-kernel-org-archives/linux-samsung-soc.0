Mark,

I'm facing the same issue on my Qualcomm based boards; my eMMCs fails
to talk to me because I'm not powering them.

The problem in my case comes from the vmmc regulator having min_uV ==
max_uV and patch 1 in this series changes the logic of
of_get_regulation_constraints() to no longer set apply_uV. I.e. we end
up never calling set_voltage(), ever.

When the mmc framework calls regulator_set_load() to change voltage
REGULATOR_CHANGE_VOLTAGE is not set (because min == max) so we will
never call set_voltage().

Before patch 1 apply_uV was set and we did set up the voltage earlier,
so regulator_get_voltage() will return a valid voltage and
regulator_set_voltage() will succeed for the valid voltages (if the
range spans the current setting).


Reinstating the following snippet in of_get_regulation_constraints()
sort this out:
if (constraints->min_uV && constraints->max_uV)
                                       constraints->apply_uV = true;


I did look at an alternative of having regulator_set_voltage() pass
and call set_voltage() if the requested voltage matches the
constraints, but this does indeed seem to mess things up. So checking
in with you before continuing on that hack.

Regards,
Bjorn
