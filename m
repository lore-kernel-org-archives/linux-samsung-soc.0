It's an Odroid-X2, so pretty similar to the U3, except that it doesn't
have any active cooling device.

The problem seems to be that of_parse_thermal_zones always sets
'no_hwmon' to true, so that thermal_zone_device_register never registers
a hwmon device when the underlaying thermal zone is setup through DT. I
don't understand the rationale behind this, even with the comment ('No
hwmon because there might be hwmon drivers registering').

Like I said, the X2 only has a passive heatsink, so no fan controlling here.


With best wishes,
