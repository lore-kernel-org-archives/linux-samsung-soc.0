I prefer this option over 3), because current driver files could be easily 
reused (just cleaned up and moved into appropriate directories), which 
would minimize the amount of needed changes.

Another reason for having two separate drivers is that on Exynos SoCs the 
PWM block is not used for timers at all, just for PWM outputs, so the 
whole part responsible for clocksource would be useless.
