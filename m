The word "standard" is used in specs, but your description looks better,
maybe even shorter version would work: "non-fullsize connectors:".

What if there is SS mux before, which muxes USB-SS and DP lines. In my
case the mux is located in USB-PHY (it is 2nd example below).
In such case there is only one graph connection to SS port and this
connection will handle both USB-SS and AltMode traffic.
Anyway from USB-C connector's point of view, there is no distinction
which lines are USB-SS, which are AltMode. In fact platform decides in
real time about muxing of SS and AltMode signals, as it depends on
cable/plug orientations. Maybe instead of mapping endpoint numbers to
SS/AltMode, we should map them to SS1/SS2 lines if necessary(???).

To be sure of your intentions. Do you want to model simple SS muxes as a
part of USB-C connector?

But it is real hardware :)
As I said earlier, DP video lines are connected to mux in USB3-PHY.
I can add this explanation to the description to make it clear.
