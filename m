So, these bindings were merged in the v3.9 merge window, using the
"samsung,i2s-v5" compatible string, and now for the v3.12 merge window,
you're proposing to break the audio description in any DT file which has
been used with v3.9..v3.11 inclusive?

The way you should be doing this is to keep the existing stuff working
and supplement it with the new method of describing the hardware.
