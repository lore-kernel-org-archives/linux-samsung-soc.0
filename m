The genpd code currently starts by powering on the domain (if it is not
on already) and then does "device restore" which is:

/**
 * pm_genpd_default_restore_state - Default PM domians "restore device state".
 * @dev: Device to handle.
 */
static int pm_genpd_default_restore_state(struct device *dev)
{
	int (*cb)(struct device *__dev);

	cb = dev_gpd_data(dev)->ops.restore_state;
	if (cb)
		return cb(dev);

	if (dev->type && dev->type->pm)
		cb = dev->type->pm->runtime_resume;
	else if (dev->class && dev->class->pm)
		cb = dev->class->pm->runtime_resume;
	else if (dev->bus && dev->bus->pm)
		cb = dev->bus->pm->runtime_resume;
	else
		cb = NULL;

	if (!cb && dev->driver && dev->driver->pm)
		cb = dev->driver->pm->runtime_resume;

	return cb ? cb(dev) : 0;
}

So I guess bus (or class or type) can take care of it. Except buses
usually call pm_generic_runtime_resume() which ends up fetching driver's
callbacks. Maybe pm_generic_runtime_*() need be a bit smarter?

Thanks.
