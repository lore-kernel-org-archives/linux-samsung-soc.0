You are right.

In the proposed solution Exynos IOMMU driver creates a separate IO 
address space
for every client device in a system and binds it to the default 
dma-mapping space
for the given device. When drivers are doing its own management of IO 
address
space, instead of relying on what is available by default with dma-mapping
interface, this will require releasing of the previously created default
structures and resources. So this flag is set by the driver doing its own
management of io address space. The flags is then checked by Exynos 
IOMMU driver
to avoid creating the default dma-mapping address space for devices 
which driver
does its own management.
