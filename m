I know the rules. It was just my whining, that it is yet another release 
cycle
that got missed. It is really disappointing, that those patches have been
floating for months and noone found issues related to different order of
initialization. It took way to long to get them scheduled for testing in
-next.

Exynos4 platform cannot be considered as fully functional without
proper l2cache support, but I assume that this is once again our fault that
we had to modify the common l2c code.
