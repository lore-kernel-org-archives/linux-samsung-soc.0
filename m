But samsung_pwm_set_platdata() and samsung_pwm_clocksource_init() can
still be called with different variants, can't they? Furthermore the
variants aren't read-only and therefore can be modified at any point in
time. So it is indeed possible for them to get different mask values.

Granted, it may be unlikely that they will but it wouldn't be all that
difficult to write the driver in a way to make it really impossible and
at the same time make sure that both driver share the same variant
information.

I see that you can't be persuaded. And everybody else seems to be okay
with it so... have it your way. I'm probably going to regret this.
