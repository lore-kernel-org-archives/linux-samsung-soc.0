I don't think there's all that much that's unique to SBSA for a
Kconfig entry. If anything it could be useful to describe dependencies
(i.e. you very likely don't want to turn off the standardized UART
driver, etc). But doing that through Kconfig is a bit clumsy, we might
be better off doing it through example defconfigs. I'm not sure we
want to do it through selects.

Sounds good to me. Are you also willing to pick up one defconfig per
vendor (but not more)? I think it's been useful to have those on arm,
even on multiplatform kernels. We used them on powerpc as well, where
we had a two-layer approach (ppc64_defconfig and per-platform configs,
pseries/iseries/pasemi/g5/cell).
