Andrezej,

Why don't you have any of the USB maintainers in to/cc?

Should this lie in  bindings/usb/connector?

This is what Rob says here https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9976043/
"We did "type" for hdmi-connector, but I think I'd really prefer 
compatible be used to distinguish as least where it may matter to s/w. 
In the HDMI case, they all are pretty much the same, just different 
physical size."

So the question is. Does it matter to this particular software implementation
if it is type A,B,C connector?
If yes, how?

Type A will never have any alternate function. It is always dedicated to USB.

Also does the size "full", "micro", "mini" matter to software?

USB controller binding (bindings/usb/generic.txt) has the speed.
I don't think there is any value for replicating it for the connector. Maybe it could
be added later if needed.

Because 1st example is "<size>-USB" and second one is "USB-<type>".

How is label going to be used? Is it being presented to end user?
If yes it should indicate what's important to the user. i.e. its function. e.g. "USB-MHL"
or "USB-DisplayPort"
