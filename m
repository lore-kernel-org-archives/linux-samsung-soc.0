I would prefer if we consider 3.18-rc[x|. That's applies also to the
below patchset, which actually fixes an issue. It would simplify the
process of handling other SOC specific patches which adds PM domain
support.

[PATCH v3 0/9] PM / Domains: Fix race conditions during boot

Obviously the patches needs to be reviewed, I guess we are still in
the process of doing that.

Kind regards
