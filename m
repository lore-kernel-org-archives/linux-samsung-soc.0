We should limit it to GPIOs with no connection to another node. For
example, I don't want to see a SD card detect in the list as that
should be in the SD host node. However, that is hard to enforce and
can change over time. Removing it would break userspace potentially.
Of course if the kernel starts own a signal that userspace used, then
that potentially breaks userspace regardless of the DT changing. OTOH,
using GPIOs in userspace is kind of use at your own risk.

The only real differences between this and Martyn's proposal are the
location of the nodes and having a compatible string. A compatible
string may be good to have. It indicates type of signal, but not
specific use. Similar to how gpio-key compatible defines the function,
but not what key code, or gpio-led does not say what color LED. A
compatible here could cover switches, mode/id/revision strapping
signals, jumpers, presence detect, etc.

Right. We need a way to query "I need the GPIO that does X" which
works across boards.

Agreed. That just came up with STM32 gpio bindings[1].

Exactly. This is one of the cases I care about. However, this is not
really a function, but it is SOC independent at least.

We also have to consider how to handle add-on boards. We probably need
a connector node which can remap connector signals to host signals in
order to have overlays independent of the host board DT. For GPIOs
this is probably a gpio-map property similar to interrupt-map. The
complicated part will be connectors that require pinmux setup of the
host.
