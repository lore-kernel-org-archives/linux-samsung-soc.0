I will note to other interested parties that in the ChromeOS tree we
never actually cleaned up the MMC voltage change stuff enough to make
use of this functionality to actually get UHS cards working (though
the code is exercised as part of WiFi).

I think upstream hasn't tended to like the chapter number references,
though Grant really liked them locally.

I've only worked with exynos which doesn't use UHS_REG for anything,
so the setting of this bit was a best-guess.  If anyone actually had a
chip that uses it then please comment / test.
