I received a Odroid XU board, based on Exynos5410, from Markus Reichl
(big thanks! it is second board from fivetechno.de) but I did not
setup testing infrastructure on it yet.

I see you pulled my entire DT branch, including the change around
Exynos5410 PMU's interrupts. I think your analysis and your follow-up
patch are correct which means that RTC on Exynso5410 might be broken
now. It is getting late in RC-cycle so I could send a follow-up pull
with fixed DT including your patch [1].

The other way is to drop my commit entirely. I could prepare a rebased
DT branch for this as well.

Let me know if you have any preferences.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
