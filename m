I understand that you ported the vendor driver from SM-G900H and used
(0x81000030) as SMC_CMD_RANDOM? The only problem with that approach is
that this code was released for different device than Odroid XU3. They
could have different Secure firmware (the library or OS in secure world)
and maybe the one on Odroid does not implement this particular SMC?

That would be probably the question to Hardkernel as they received TZSW
from vendor.

Once again I assume you're looking at vendor code. Please have it mind
that it may contain anything...

The exynos_smc() call does not return a value. The extern declaration is
misleading. Instead the exynos_smc() just executes smc instruction and
first argument (value in R0) is used as a return value.
