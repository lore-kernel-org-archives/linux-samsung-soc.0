Please read Documentation/process/SubmittingPatches. Search for 'This
patch' ....

A changelog should explain the problem first and then explain the concept
of the fix. You start explaining WHAT the patch does and not what the
problem is.

This has nothing to do with suspend. That can happen with a normal cpu
offline/online sequence as well, which happens to be utilized by
suspend/resume.

Please trim back traces so they contain only useful information. There is
no point in having all these useless stack entries and whatever, which do
not at all help to diagnose the problem.

I'll fix that up when applying the patch. Checkout the resulting changelog
and please be more careful next time.

Adding the version tags is pointless when you have a Fixes tag, which
allows the stable maintainers to find the affected kernels automatically.

This Signed-off-by sequence is wrong.

Seung-Woo reported the problem. You wrote the patch and sent it to the
mailing list. The above sequence suggests that you wrote the patch and
Seung-Woo sent it to the mailing list, which is obviously not the case.

Thanks,
