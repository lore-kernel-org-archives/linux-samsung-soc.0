There should be way to distinguish between the two types of 'cd-gpios' value.

(A) a 'cd-gpios' line that connects the card-detect pin of the mmc
physical slot to the card-detect pad to the mmc host controller.

(B) a 'cd-gpios' line that is connected to the card-detect pin of the
slot but not to the card-detect pad of the mmc host controller (used
either as gpio interrupt or polled gpio line).

So the binding 'cd-external' can act as an additional qualifier to
value of 'cd-gpios' to represent the second type. Hence, the bindings
proposed by Chris does support all the possible combinations of
card-detection used by the Samsung sdhci controller driver.

Thanks,
Thomas.
