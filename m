The vendor-prefixes documentation for device tree bindings includes
'linux' as an option. And I was trying to encode the linux specific
host controller capabilities using the above bindings.

Ok. I will remove all these linux specific bindings and replace with a
more generic ones. Bindings will be defined for all the linux defined
host capabilities. Non-linux platforms can add additional bindings as
required. A function to parse such properties from a controller device
node could actually be shared among all the mmc/sd host controller
drivers in linux. I will redo this patch and submit again.

Thanks Olof for your review and comments.

Thomas.
