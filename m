What I mean is that the .round_rate() method is defined with two output 
values - best parent rate (*prate) and resulting rate of the clock 
itself (the value returned). Now, your function uses different divisor 
value to calculate the return value than the one found to give best 
delta, which is wrong.

They are implemented using slightly different ways (the one in 
clk-divider is more generic), but I believe they calculate exactly the same.

I'm not sure how much of the code added by this patch could be reused by 
pre-Exynos platforms. AFAIK, except s5v210, their ARM frequency change 
semantics are completely different, so maybe we shouldn't bloat Exynos 
code by trying to make it too generic.

I believe we should keep this Exynos-specific right now to make the code 
simpler and, if needed and found to be appropriate after analyzing how 
cpufreq works on them, it might be extended to support older SoCs as 
well in future.

Semantically, the ARM clock can use two different parents, which are not 
encapsulated inside, but instead are fed into the ARM clock block from 
outside, so CCF should know about it.

However, looking at the clock core code again, it seems to support only 
num_parents > 1 when .get_parent() op is implemented, so for now it 
should be safe to keep it as is.

If we keep this Exynos-specific, which I believe is better than making 
the code overly generic, this could be simplified.

I don't see any real need for this for now. It can be added later if 
such need shows up. For now, I don't think much of this code will be 
reusable on pre-s5pv210 SoCs anyway and s5pv210 needs alternate parent 
too, so it's safe to support only such setup.

Could this be added later as an extension? The original Exynos cpufreq 
doesn't seem to change these divisors and I'm not sure if we should be 
touching them. I'd rather keep the semantics of the old driver, at least 
for now.

I don't think so. Your code always seem to do the transition in exactly 
the same order, regardless of transition direction. I assume that 
original driver contained such distinction, because of some hardware 
requirements and so such semantics should be preserved in new code.

This series is a refactor and should not introduce functional changes. 
Any semantic changes should be done as separate patches to make sure 
that no regressions are introduced.

Well, all such properties used to follow this convention, so I'm not 
sure why we should be changing this.

To make this more clear, I'd say you should simply add 1 when calling 
kzalloc() and not include sentinel row in nr_rows...

As I said, I would recommend keeping this simple to cover just Exynos 
SoCs for now. The design might also consider s5pv210, but it's going to 
be fully converted to DT as well, so it should be safe to make this code 
DT-only.
