EXYNOS_MIPI_DSI and EXYNOS_LCD_S6E8AX0 are made tristate too. And that
is, I think, what counts. See below.

For anyone wondering how these two drivers can be made modular with only
a few tweaks to the build system: that is because exynos_mipi_dsi.c and
s6e8ax0.c already contain module specific boilerplate. They probably
already contained that boilerplate when they were added three years ago.
(Perhaps the changelog should mention this.)

I have tested this only lightly but I do think this hunk is not needed.
Because basically all that this entry does is making EXYNOS_MIPI_DSI and
EXYNOS_LCD_S6E8AX0 available. And that works just as well if it's a
bool. Correct?

I don't speak Makefilese fluently, so I have to ask. Is the -mod
extension needed because a module built from multiple files can't have a
name that matches the name of one of its .c files (minus the .c
extension, of course)?
