Well, looking at Exynos SoCs, the structure of core block is very 
similar on all of them. You have a single mux to select between MPLL and 
APLL and then a number of dividers that need to be configured 
quasi-atomically when CPU frequency is to be changed or, looking at 
higher level, a set of registers, which values need to be changed 
(possibly masked).

I'd say it wouldn't require much more effort to make this common at 
least for all currently supported Exynos SoCs (except 5440, which has 
completely different clock logic).

Best regards,
Tomasz
