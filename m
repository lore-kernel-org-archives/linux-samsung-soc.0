"awkward situation" and "ritual suffering" above, are two practical
issues that we see.

So we at least agree that the "feature" is unused so far.
And I doubt if it would ever make sense to batch transfers in slave
dma (unlike offloading on async-dma) because the user has to also
setup the master for each queued request, mostly if not always.

As Russell pointed out, that ain't the case either.
So we are yet to figure out benefits of having explicit
issue_pending() after tx_submit().
