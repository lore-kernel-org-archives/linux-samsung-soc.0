Yes, that's the approach I also intend to take in the next step.

But, it's not that simple. Since this requires a mechanism for drivers
to bring their device's PM domains into power state prior doing probe.
We don't have such today. I do have some ideas about this, but I think
we need to keep that as a separate discussion.

This will hit only during boot, until late_init. Unless you have a
platform that keeps rebooting all the time, is this really a big
worry?

Still, I certainly agree that we should strive for a solution where
it's possible to leave PM domains powered off at init. It's should be
too hard to support this from genpd point of view, but
drivers/subsystems will need some adaptations.

Sorry, if missed to comment of that. I guess I have at this point.

Kind regards
