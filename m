Hello,

This preliminary patch series adds support for Samsung S5PC110 SoC.
S5PC110 belongs to S5PC1XX family (CortexA8 ARM core), but differs in
many places from the S5PC100 SoC: new memory map, different clock
hierarchy, new gpio banks and much more powerful integrated peripherals.
Such differences cannot be easily handled in the current Samsung
machine&platform framework. To avoid duplication of code and adding yet
another plat-* directory, we decided to introduce sub-platforms in
the current s5pc1xx platform.

First 8 patches prepare s5pc1xx platform code for introduction of the
new sub-platform approach. Then in the next 11 patches all core
functions and drivers are subsequently added, so S5PC110 sub-platform
gets similar level of support as S5PC100. The last patch updated
MAINTAINERS information.

This patch series has been prepared against latest ARM Kernel tree from
http://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/arm/kernel/git-cur/linux-2.6-arm.git/

This is the second version of this patch series. The following issues
reported by Ben have been fixed: gpiolib support has been rewriten, more
SoC specific files have been moved to mach-s5pc* directories (gpio chip,
plls and clocks definitions). Also author/sender issues are resolved.

The clock issue in S5PC110 driver has not been addressed. The driver
uses clock API in the same way as it is handled in other Samsung UART
drivers. This clock issue should be resolved in a separate patch which
would fix all Samsung drivers at once. Until then we would like to use
the current approach.
