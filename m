Aha, I lost some things that I back port the pstore/ram.c from chrome
v3.14 tree which driver would parsed the "ramoops" compatible.

And those "ramoops" device node should be structured by bootloader in
chromeos, so we won't see anything about "ramoops" in DT binding. Due
to I can't upgraded the loader of Peach Pit, so I chose to structure that
device manually. (detailed properties just `cat 
/proc/device-tree/ramoops/*`)
