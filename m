I understand that, but the issue with CPU0 is still a blocker from my
PoV.

Previously you said that you did not have access to the source code
rather than not having help from the relevant firmware engineers. I take
it you have informed them of the issue with CPU0?

While that may be the case, PSCI is a more generic standard, and it is
used on systems where CPU0 can be hot unplugged. So Exynos-specific
details cannot dictate how the kernel PSCI driver should behave.

Is there a particular reason that CPU0 cannot be hotplugged?

In PSCI 0.2 and later it's possible to determine whether a trusted OS
prohibits a core from being hotplugged, but this mechanism doesn't exist
in earlier versions. I am not averse to adding a property to PSCI 0.1
to mark a CPU as not being hotpluggable if there is a fundamental reason
(i.e. not simply a bug) for this being the case.

Thanks,
Mark.
