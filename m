I run some more tests which adds more confusion. If the usb3503 hub does
not turn off/on the supply (LAN regulator supply in reality) it usually
does not show up as USB device (lsusb) neither. In such case sometimes
it is present, sometimes not.

"Hardware" reset with regulator fixes all the problems: with LAN and
with USB hub... It really does not match the schematics but apparently
usb3503 also needs the regulator.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
