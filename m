Ok, makes sense. Thanks. By the way, I was checking why this patch did
not lead me to a crash as you described. u-boot seems to be overriding
the memory node in the dts file and creating a new memory node with
the memory banks information that u-boot has. So looking at
/proc/device-tree/memory/reg, there are multiple 256MB sized entries
there.

Regards,
Thomas.
