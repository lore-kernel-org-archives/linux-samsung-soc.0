Overall this looks okay to me! Even if I don't really like the
approach, it seems like this is the only viable option there is right
now.

One minor improvement that I could think of, is to use also a late
initcall in conjunction with the delayed work. So, instead of
scheduling a work unconditionally when -EPROBE_DEFER is returned from
amba_device_try_add(), you can postpone the *first* re-try to be done
from a late initcall.

Of course, as devices may be added also after the late initcall, you
need to keep a flag which tells amba_device_add() whether it can rely
on the late initcall to re-try, or if it needs to schedule a work by
itself.

Kind regards
Uffe
