1. Introduction

Following patches aim to clean up the current implementation of the thermal
framework on Exynos devices.

The main goal was to use a generic code for reading thermal configuration
(of-thermal.c). Due to that redundant exynos_thermal_common.[h|c] files
were removed.

Around 400 lines of code (LOC) were removed directly by this patch, which
is around 20% of the Exynos thermal code base.

This work should NOT bring any functional changes to Exynos thermal 
subsystem.

2. Patch-set structure

Then the cpu_cooling functionality has been preserved to allow cooling
devices by reducing operating frequency. Definition of trip points and
cpufreq's cooling properties were moved to device tree.

Then the rework of the way in which configuration data is provided to
the Exynos thermal subsystem was performed. Now device tree is used for
configuration.

3. Dead code removal

Thermal support for some SoCs, previously available in the exynos_tmu_data.c 
file, was removed since, as of (almost) 3.19-rc3, they didn't have TMU bindings.

Moreover, support for cpu_cooling devices was preserved only on those
SoCs which had available and working cpufreq driver.

4. Testing

Test devices:
- Exynos4210 - Trats (TMU zone + cpu_cooling)
- Exynos4412 - Trats2/Odroid U3 (TMU zone + cpu_cooling)
- Exynos5250 - Arndale (TMU zone + cpu_cooling)
- Exynos5420 - Arndale-octa (only TMU zones)

Unfortunately, I don't posses Exynos5440 for testing. Its functionality
has been preserved in the code, but not tested on the hardware. I would
be grateful for help in testing.
