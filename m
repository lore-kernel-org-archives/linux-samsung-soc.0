That's why I'm saying provide an option to turn this behaviour on - I
agree that it's useful to be able to show the feature, I just think it's
going to catch users out if they're not warned that it's happening
somehow.

To be fair the users doing this the individual drivers do look OK by
themselves - there's only a problem when it comes to system integration
and that's not going to be obvious unless someone has reviewed the
drivers while understanding the clock tree for the chip as a whole.
