Adding to what Doug already mentioned in the thread, in the cases
where we saw cpu_do_idle fail we noticed the following:
1) No wake-up source as having woken up the system (by checking the WAKEUP_STAT)
2) On checking all the EINT Pend registers the values indicated no
pending interrupts.

The UM says that the PMU may fail to go to suspend when there are
pending interrupt events. The patch assumed that we have a non-wakeup
interrupt pending causing "wfi" to fail, especially as we saw the
failure more often with no_console_suspend.
