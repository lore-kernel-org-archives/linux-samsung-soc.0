Ok, I haven't tried to recreate this issue. I will try and do that.

I did notice this a few times before but today I was able to reproduce
this consistently with other test cases. This timeout is because the
CPU clock blocks of the cluster that has been turned down are being
reconfigured, which on Exynos will not work. The following is a
temporary patch which solves this issue.

Subject: [PATCH] TEMP: cpufreq/bL: let the CPU switch complete before
scaling frequency

On Exynos5420/Exyons5800, the clock blocks that make up the CPU clock
supply do no operate when the cluster in which they belong is powered off.
The CPU clock supply path is PLL -> Mux/Dividers -> CPU_clock.

In the arm_big_little CPUfreq driver, the frequency is scaled first and
then the CPU is switched to the new cluster. In case the switch was for
the first-man CPU in that new cluster, the frequency scaling step in
arm_big_little CPUfreq driver would not work for Exynos since the
in-bound cluster is powered off at that point. Note: On Exynos, the
cluster is powered off when all the CPUs in that cluster are powered off
which implies that the CPU clock blocks for that cluster do not operate
anymore.

So when using arm_big_little CPUfreq driver for Exynos, two changes are
required. The first change is to let the CPU to switch to the new cluster
before scaling the frequency. The second change is to ensure that the
switch has been completed before scaling the frequency.

With these changes, the message "wait_until_divider_stable: timeout in
divider stabilization" is not seen anymore.
