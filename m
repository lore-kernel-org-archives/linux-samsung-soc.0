Yes, I was talking about same cases. Perhaps,I think it holds true in general
for PLLs, whose set_rate can be called.

I think by declaring all these different table as __init,
and creating a copy to be used while registering, we can
save a little memory as well as the unnecessary cost which
we have to bear while doing set_rate() and round_rate()
by using single big table(for some time critical cases).

Its good to know whether same PMS values can be reused, from hardware guys.

Using different tables we can always blindly stick to recommended values without
bothering much every time, whether existing PMS can be reused or not
while adding new cases.
