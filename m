I found something also on my S3C2440. The board doesn't die but prints
garbage on the console. Indeed the baud rate guessing is broken (it's ok
if specified manually on the cmdline),

    serial: samsung: remove all uses of get_clksrc and set_clksrc
    
    With clkdev based clock lookup support, the clock set and get operation
    using clock names communicated between the samsung uart driver and the
    SoC specific extension can be removed.
    
    In addition to that, for each platform specific extension, add the
    default clock selection, number of clock options for uart baud generator,
    clock selection bit mask and shift values which is required by the
    clkdev support in samsung uart driver.
    
    The default clock selection value 'def_clk_sel' specifies the default clock
    to be used as the source clock for baud rate generator in case the platform
    code does not specify the same.

To restore previous functionality I had to change the default UCON clock
back to UCLK.

The additional condition is that board file does not specify a
