Nah, I think Ack is completely right, but still this series is quite
standalone, e.g. it does not really belong to samsung-clk nor any other
clock subtree, so I thought you would be applying them directly.

I believe Lee has already applied this one, but in future, to avoid such
confusion, if it's more convenient for you, I can send you any clock
series as pull requests.

Best regards,
