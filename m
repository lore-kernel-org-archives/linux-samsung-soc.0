I think they only reference a small portion of the total contents.
The idea was to make whatever is really needed by drivers visible in
a header and keep everything else in the mach directory.

Right. I would use <mach/gpio-samsung.h> though, so you don't
have to #ifdef it on the platform as you currently do in the
gpio driver.

Doing the full DT migration would of course be best, but I would
suspect that to take quite a while still.

Ok.

Well, we can't do it all at once, and we have to start untangling
this somewhere. Getting rid of mach/gpio.h sounds as good to me
as any other part of the puzzle, as long as we don't do something
bad along the lines that comes back to bite us later.

Let me have another look first, maybe I can find an intermediate
step that helps you on your conquest to kill mach/gpio.h.
