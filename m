Unfortunately, either I missed it or it was a time I couldn't spend much

I could see this as a board level power domain. However the difference 
is we are not generally exposing internal SOC details the same way as 
board level components. Perhaps we could extend power domains to board 
level, but that is not what was done here.

If there is a control path hierarchy, then we try to model that in DT 
with child nodes. In cases of SDIO and USB, there is a clear hierarchy. 
Ignoring the discovery ordering problem, we already have defined ways to 
describe GPIO connections, regulators, etc. to devices. Describing those 
things separately from the device to solve a particular issue that is 
really a kernel limitation is what I don't like.
