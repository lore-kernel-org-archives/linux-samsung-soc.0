no Krzysztof, I'm sorry, but this patch has been formatted with
the diff algorithm *you* asked, -B50% both version 2 (where you
didn't comment) and version 3. If you still don't like it, please
don't blame me, blame the algorithm.

Now we can stay here at trying random diff algorithms (as they
give more or less the same result) or you tell me which exact
algorithm you want me to use. Besides, for me it's clear,
tm2-common is all new, while in tm2 you have on one side the '-'
(if it applies nothing has changed) on the bottom the '+'.
