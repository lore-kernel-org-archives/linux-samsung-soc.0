Actually, I'm not sure that's true, but I'll talk through it and you
can point to where I'm wrong (I often am!)

If you're a wakeup device then you need to be ready to handle
interrupts as soon as the "noirq" phase of resume is done, right?
Said another way: you need to be ready to handle interrupts _before_
the normal resume code is called and be ready to handle interrupts
even _before_ the early resume code is called.

That means if you are implementing a bus that's needed by any devices
with wakeup interrupts then it's your responsibility to also be
prepared to run this early.

In this particular case the max77686 driver doesn't need to do
anything at all to be ready to handle interrupts.  It's suspend and
resume code is just boilerplate "enable wakeups / disable wakeups" and
it has no "noirq" code.  The max77686 driver doesn't have any "noirq"
wake call because it would just be empty.

Said another way: the problem isn't that the max77686 wakeup gets
called before the i2c wakeup.  The problem is that i2c is needed ASAP
once IRQs are enabled and thus needs to be run noirq.

Does that sound semi-correct?
