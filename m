We already have properties which indicate this driver can be used by a
platform: opp table and a clock for the cpu. If this information is
not sufficient to determine whether you can use this driver or not,
then you simply need to match against the platform. Perhaps the match
list should be a blacklist rather than a whitelist, so new platforms
work without a kernel change.

Alternatively, create a new OPP binding that addresses this and all
the other limitations in the current OPP binding.

The fact that linux needs a way to create a platform device to enable
a certain driver is not a DT problem. I proposed a solution for how to
get this out of the platform code [1], but evidently we want people to
open code the exceptions and adding boilerplate helpers will just
encourage the exceptions.
