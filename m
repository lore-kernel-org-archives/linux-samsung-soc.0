Sounds ok to me. The main part I want to avoid is having two separate device
nodes in the DT for one physical device, but there are multiple ways to get
there.

Sure, no problem with that.

Ok. Don't be too tied to the MFD concept though if it causes problems.
In many cases calling platform_device_register_resndata or similar is
actually easier than MFD, especially if you only want a single child
device. Either way is fine though.

Ok.

Right. If you want to use the clocksource_of_init() infratstructure for this
(which is probably a good idea), please base your series on top of the
clksrc/cleanup branch in arm-soc.

This seems unnecessary, if the only purpose of the platform driver is to
export the MFD cell. In that case, I would actually suggest a simpler model
where the PWM driver registers the main platform driver directly and
calls a function exported by the clocksource driver to get the regmap
structure and anything else it may need (possibly initializing the driver
in the case where it is not used as the clocksource but only provides
the registers for PWM).

Yes, either the MFD cell, or the exported symbol, whichever ends up easier.

Right. If anything else comes up, I'd suggest we discuss it on IRC (#armlinux
on irc.freenode.net) tomorrow for faster round-trip, or I can call you on
the phone if you like. I'm available all day tomorrow, just send me your
(landline) phone number by private email.
