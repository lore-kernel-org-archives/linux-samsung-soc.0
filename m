Both Exynos5250 and Exynos5420 had similar issues and $subject is the fix
for 5250 while 5420 is fixed by my "ARM: dts: Make DP a consumer of DISP1
power domain on Exynos5420" patch that was posted a long time ago. I have
pinged Kukjin several times about this patch and he said that he will pick
it this weekend [0].

It is indeed very frustrating how many Exynos patches seems to be falling
through the crack, even important fixes like these ones that allow boards
to boot again.

Kevin suggested that Krzysztof could collect and queue patches [1] to help
Kukjin and start acting as a co-maintatiner which I think it's a very good
idea and Krzysztof already did for some patches during the 4.1 cycle.
