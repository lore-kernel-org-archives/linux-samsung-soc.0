Yes, but then that is a user decision and shouldn't really be there
either. In other words, ether the bootloader should set bootargs
(which even a vendor u-boot should be able to do either directly or
the zImage can take it from the ATAGS) or a user can edit the dts and
carry that change.

However, there are probably plenty of examples in the kernel that
counter what I just said.
