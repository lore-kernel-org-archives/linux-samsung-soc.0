Yes, but my point was that those bus types might need to be changed.

We can't make everyone happy at the same time if their ideas about what to do
are different.

Like "oh, I can't power up this thing, so I should fail ->probe()"?

Then your driver would need to depend on the specific knowledge about the
given PM domain, I'm afraid.

If you want error handling like that, it needs to be handled by the core,
so as to avoid calling the bus type's ->probe() as well in that case.

So to summarize:

- Devices need to be added to power domains before really_probe() is called
  for them.  Otherwise we'll have ordering problems all over.

- Runtime PM (if compiled in) needs to be enabled for all devices in power
  domains by default.  Otherwise devices may lose power as a result for
  power management of the other devices in the same domain.

- The core should try to power up domains before calling really_probe() both
  for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set and unset, so ->probe() can always make the
  "device is accessible" assumption.

- Bus types may need to do more on top of that in their ->probe(), so the
  driver's ->probe() can make that assumption too in all cases.

Does that make sense to you?
