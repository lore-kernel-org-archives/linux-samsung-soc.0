Ok, I will change that.

Ok, I traced what actually happens for me in this case, and it turns
out for tuning that the extra Data CRC interrupt doesn't matter (it
looks like the RTO bit I mentioned before isn't always there).

This is because we're doing the fifo and controller reset from within
the tasklet, which holds host->lock, it does clear RINTSTS, and also
eventually calls dw_mci_request_end() which ends by setting
host->state to STATE_IDLE.  The tasklet then wakes up again
immediately but sees the host->state as STATE_IDLE and exits.   We
could  mask the Data CRC interrupt before doing the controller reset,
if you'd like.

I'll post an updated patch with the changes so far, thanks.
