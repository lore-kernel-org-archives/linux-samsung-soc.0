The output of the PLL is the input to a tree of clock nodes. One of
the outputs from this tree is the clock to ARM. And the other outputs
do not serve as parents to any other clocks in the system but are used
internally in the bus interconnect. In addition to that, there are
clock speed restrictions for the clock outputs from this tree with
respect to speeds of other clocks in this clock tree.

Hence, this entire clock tree has been purged into a single composite
clock which includes mux and dividers. So the clock tree now looks
like PLL Output -> Custom Composite Clock -> ARM clock output.

But there is a problem when changing the ARM clock speed which in turn
causes change in PLL clock speed. When PLL clock speed has to be
changed, the PLL has to be first turned off. Which means the clock to
ARM core is cut-off. To avoid that, the Custom Composite Clock now has
to get its clock from another source until the PLL is ready to operate
again. So this composite clock does an automatic re-parenting (the mux
is within is composite clock) because it knows that it is its
responsibility to ensure clock ARM all the time.

The re-parenting is mostly done to keep the ARM CPU clocked while the
PLL is stopped, reprogrammed and restarted. One of the side effects of
that is, the clock speed of the temporary parent could be higher then
what is allowed due to the ARM voltage at the time of re-parenting.
That is the reason to use the safe voltage.

Okay.I agree. And I did feel that adding the optional "safe voltage"
feature in cpufreq-cpu0 would help Exynos platforms reuse this driver.
And adding this feature in cpufreq-cpu did not feel like some
orthogonal approach but a logical extension.

Okay. Thanks Mike for your comments. And sorry for the delay in my reply.
