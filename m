Packing read requests requires preparation of two requests. After sending
the header we wait for its completion before sending the next request
(mmc_wait_for_req is used). Therefore, if we try to pack 2 read requests
we might end up with worse performance in comparison to sending each
request by itself (which allows the preparation of one request while the
other is sent).
I suggest to check the size of the packed commands list and in case it is
less than 3 send the requests one by one. If you move mmc_blk_chk_packable
to queue.c after the first fetch this change should be very easy and can
be done by removing the requests from the packed_list and calling issue_fn
for each one of them.
