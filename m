Not exactly. Each phandle + #power-domain-cells cells are used just for 
single power domain.

The cells here are used merely as the identifier used by power domain 
driver to translate a power domain specifier from DT to a kernel 
pointer. It's up to driver bindings to select the number of cells to 
properly identify a power domain.

As an example (from different world, but showing the same mechanism), 
let's see a common pattern of GPIO banks on some SoC:

GPA0
GPA1
GPB0
GPB1
GPC0
GPC1

One might assign a single-cell ID to each bank ending with a namespace 
of integers from 0 to 5 that would be used as follows:

#define GPA0 0
#define GPA1 1
#define GPB0 2
#define GPB1 3
#define GPC0 4
#define GPC1 5

reset-gpios = <&gpio GPA0 4>;

However one might also consider assigning one cell to bank set (e.g. 
GPA) and one cell to identify the bank inside of a set, like on the 
following example:

#define GPA 0
#define GPB 1
#define GPC 2

reset-gpios = <&gpio GPA 0 4>;

Good bindings should allow arbitrary identification schemes to let a 
driver developer use the one that suits the hardware he's working on.

There are two generic xlate helpers provided for the most common cases 
that are likely to be reused by most drivers. For more complex cases 
it's up to the driver to implement its own mapping function. It can be 
promoted to a generic one later if such need shows up.

Tomasz
