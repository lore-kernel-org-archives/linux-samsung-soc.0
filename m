The reason for the BUG that you're seeing is that the leds-pwm driver
differentiates between PWMs that can sleep and those that can't. This
used to be limited to some PWMs that were attached to a slow bus like
I2C, or that called functions which might sleep (like clk_prepare()).
With commit d1cd21427747 ("pwm: Set enable state properly on failed
call to enable"), effectively all PWM drivers may sleep. The lock
introduced in that commit must also be a mutex because it protects
sections which may sleep themselves (->enable() and ->set_polarity())
so turning it into a spinlock won't work for the general case.

Given that this is currently broken and we're quite close to -rc1 I
suggest the following fix for now:

--- >8 ---
diff --git a/drivers/pwm/core.c b/drivers/pwm/core.c
index d24ca5f281b4..7831bc6b51dd 100644
--- a/drivers/pwm/core.c
+++ b/drivers/pwm/core.c
@@ -889,7 +889,7 @@ EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(devm_pwm_put);
   */
 bool pwm_can_sleep(struct pwm_device *pwm)
 {
-	return pwm->chip->can_sleep;
+	return true;
 }
 EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(pwm_can_sleep);
=20
--- >8 ---

For v4.6 I can remove all usage of the ->can_sleep and pwm_can_sleep()
because they're effectively useless now.

Does that sound reasonable to everyone?

Anand, the above should fix the issue for you. Can you give it a try
and report if it doesn't?

Thanks,
Thierry
