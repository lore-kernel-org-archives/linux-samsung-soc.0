+CC Linus, as this became also pinctrl related.

To add a bit more information about the hardware, setting up a GPIO
interrupt on Samsung SoCs is a two-step operation - in addition to
trigger configuration in a dedicated register, the pinmux must be also
reconfigured to GPIO interrupt, which is a different function than
normal GPIO input, although I/O-wise they both behave in the same way
and gpio_get_value() can be used on a pin configured as IRQ as well.

I'm afraid that such design implies that handling of this in the driver
must be done on a very low level, because it involves three possible
interfaces changing the pinmux - pinctrl, GPIO and irqchip and such
subtletes like gpio_direction_input() that shouldn't neither fail if a
pin is already configured as an interrupt nor change the configuration
to normal input.

Best regards,
Tomasz
