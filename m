In this case I'm fine with the changes, but I'm still not sure if that'=
s=20
a good idea or not.

Sticking to ISO C still sounds better than doing something on our own.=20
And it now looks a bit different than it was in 2004, stdint.h is widel=
y=20
adopted in userspace if I'm not completely mistaken.

Anyway you're perfectly right that Linus need to decide and I'm not in=20
the mod to argue with him either (got way to much other things to do as=
=20
well).

Christian.
