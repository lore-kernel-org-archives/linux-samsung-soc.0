I have listed down the need for the three tables in the reply to your

The core clock can round the rate requested by the cpufreq driver and
provide an output with least delta (but always less then the frequency
requested by cpufreq).

That is not a hard rule. When used in products, 'z' is influenced by
the power/performance needs of the product and 'y' tends to be
superset of 'z'. 'x' is SoC specific and 'y' can a derived set of 'x'.
