I'd also like to add that I don't see any correlation with mentioned
dead code and possibility of adding new SoCs. The code is mostly relate=
d
to unused/untested features and support for new SoCs might just be adde=
d
without those optional features. Moreover, less features (especially
untested) means less hassle to add new SoC, because you have less thing=
s
to test. Especially considering the fact that you would have to test
originally untested code and fix it if it turns out to be broken.

Best regards,
Tomasz
