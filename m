Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that the driver does have issues
since the commit mentioned (3146bee) broke DT backward compatibility.

As far as I understand, the breakage is that any DTS that followed the
DT binding documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-samsung.txt is not working
with the current driver. So is not that some boards are broken, is
that the driver is broken and it has been broken for more than a year
(the commit date is Jun 21 2013).

I think that if changing the binding is not possible, at least we
should document this new "cs-gpio" property that is looked in the top
level SPI node after commit 3146bee and also revert the default in
order to allow DTs using the old binding to keep working.

By default not having the "cs-gpio" property in the SPI dev node
should mean that the "cs-gpio" property in the controller-data node
should be used to signal the chip-select and having the "cs-gpio"
property in the SPI node should mean that the native chip select
should be used instead of a GPIO. That preserves the old DT binding
semantic while making the GPIO to be optional.

Of course in that case the property name does not make too much sense,
so probably should be changed to "cs-native" or something like that.
But I still don't understand why this is needed in the first place
since according to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
you can use the cs-gpios property to specify that a native chip-select
will be used instead of a GPIO by doing:

cs-gpios = <&gpio1 0 0> <0>

cs0 : &gpio1 0 0
cs1 : native

Right, since the DT binding has been broken for a year and because is
not consistent with the bindings used by all other SPI drivers, many
agreed that it was one of the exceptional cases where the DT binding
can be rethought and changed to use the generic "cs-gpios" property
already supported by SPI core. It breaks backward compatibility that's
true but the DT binding has been broken anyways and nobody noticed
before.

The other option is what I said above, fixing the DT binding
compatibility breakage while keeping the custom binding for this SPI
driver.

I think this problem could be present in other SPI drivers as well? So
maybe the right fix for this is to convert the SPI core gpio handling
to use the new descriptor-based gpio API instead of the integer-base
one?
