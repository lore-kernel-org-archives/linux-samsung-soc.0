I've already pointed that those patches depend on other previously merged to
exynos and arm-soc trees, but both Arnd and Kukjin said that those patch 
series
should go via your kernel tree:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/11/15/158

That's why in v9 I rebased patches once again onto vanilla v3.18-rc4 and 
uploaded
to your patch tracker. I see the following two possibilities to get them 
merged:

1. Merge patches to rmk tree and resolve the merge conflict. The 
conflict IS quite
easy to resolve - both trees, arm-soc and rmk only adds some code and 
the goal is
simply to have both chunks added.

2. Merge the previous version (v8 from the above link) to arm-soc tree, 
where it
applies cleanly on for-next, preferably with Russell's Acked-by.

Arnd, Russell: which approach do you prefer? How can I help to get it 
merged?

Best regards
