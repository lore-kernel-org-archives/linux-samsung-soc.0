In the cover letter is written:

 "- patch 3 diff has been generated with -B50%"

in "Changes in v2:". In v3 patch 3 has become patch 2.

I guess you're right, this has been generated from Jaechul's PC
who perhaps has a different version. I have version 2.11.0 and I
have same output as you.

I will send the patch generated from my PC as reply to your mail.
