I left the references for the end of this cover letter and finally forgot
about them. Please accept my apologies ;).

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/exynos/power_domain.txt
[2] arch/arm/mach-exynos/pm_domains.c

Also it might be good to mention that I was heavily inspired by
implementation of clock providers in Common Clock Framework in case of
provider registration and look-up and also by my Exynos power domain
implementation (now removed by this series ;)) in case of code binding
devices to power domains.

Best regards,
Tomasz
