Yes correct, we had discussion about this in above post. But at that ti=
me I was not having enough points to
put forward for keeping Exynos PMU driver in MFD folder.
At that point there was only one idea behind keeping Exynos PMU that in=
 future it will be reused for ARM64
based SoC for PM related functionalities.
But in this series we have implemented Exynos Power Domain for Samsung'=
s ARM64 based SoCs.

As far as I can see this will in following ways -

1: Moving out PM domain specific code from mach-exynos and reuse of sam=
e code for ARM64 based SoC also.
2: Since PM domain relies on PMU registers and does not have its own DT=
 binding, MFD client and MFD device
is most suitable for making this kind of platform drivers.
