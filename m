IMHO, just change it to wait_for_completion_killable_timeout() - that's
a much better change than the change you're proposing.

If we think about it...  The current code uses this:

                if (!wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(&dsim_wr_comp,
                                                        MIPI_FIFO_TIMEOUT)) {
                        dev_warn(dsim->dev, "command write timeout.\n");
                        mutex_unlock(&dsim->lock);
                        return -EAGAIN;
                }

which has the effect of treating a signal as "success", and doesn't return
an error.  So, if the calling application receives (eg) a SIGPIPE or a
SIGALRM, we proceed as if we received the FIFO empty interrupt and doesn't
cause an error.

Your change results in:

                timeout = wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(
                                        &dsim_wr_comp, MIPI_FIFO_TIMEOUT);
                if (timeout <= 0) {
                        dev_warn(dsim->dev,
                                "command write timed-out/interrupted.\n");
                        mutex_unlock(&dsim->lock);
                        return -EAGAIN;
                }

which now means that this call returns -EAGAIN when a signal is raised.

Now, further auditing of this exynos crap (and I really do mean crap)
shows that this function is assigned to a method called "cmd_write".
Grepping for that shows that *no caller ever checks the return value*!

So, really, there's a bug here in that we should _never_ complete on a
signal, and we most *definitely can not* error out on a signal either.
The *only* sane change to this code without author/maintainer input is
to change this to wait_for_completion_killable_timeout() - so that
signals do not cause either premature completion nor premature failure
of the wait.

The proper fix is absolutely huge: all call paths need to be augmented
with code to detect this function failing, and back out whatever changes
they've made, and restoring the previous state (if they can) and
propagate the error all the way back to userland, so that syscall
restarting can work correctly.  _Only then_ is it safe to use a call
which causes an interruptible sleep.

Personally, I'd be happier seeing this moved into drivers/staging and
eventually deleted from the kernel unless someone is willing to review
the driver and fix some of these glaring problems.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there was _loads_ of this kind of crap there.
