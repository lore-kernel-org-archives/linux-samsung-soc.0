Yay!

I'd worry about the standard connectors first, but probably good to have 
an idea of how vendor connectors need to be extended.

We did "type" for hdmi-connector, but I think I'd really prefer 
compatible be used to distinguish as least where it may matter to s/w. 
In the HDMI case, they all are pretty much the same, just different 
physical size.

child of the controller is also an option. There's already prec

Do we really see cases where the connector is slower than the 
controller? Plus things like "ls" with an type A connector are not 
valid.

What does powered mean?

This is really "type" if you compare to HDMI.

These all are implied by "samsung,usb-connector-11pin".

I think this should be 2 ports, not 2 endpoints. Think of ports as 
different data streams and endpoints are either the same data stream 
muxed or fanned out depending on direction. Now for Type-C, 1 port for 
USB and alternate modes is probably correct.
