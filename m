That doesn't stop stuff changing in the future.  We've been here before.
Let's do the job properly if we're going to do the job at all.

If people still whine about this, I will force a change to make it
harder to do the wrong thing - I will get rid of the _part_number
interface replacing it with one which always returns the implementor
as well as the part number so both have to be checked.

We never call firmware operations from assembly code.  However, in exynos'
case, it's not running in non-secure mode because it's happily reading
and writing these registers with no issue.

Platforms running in non-secure mode already have to ensure that various
work-arounds are implemented in their firmware/boot loader, and this
really is no different (we wouldn't need this code in the kernel in the
first place if the firmware/boot loader would get its act together.)

We get there from kernel/cpu_pm.c, when the notifier chain is called.
The notifier chain is called while taking a read lock on
cpu_pm_notifier_lock.

If this is about the last CPU going down, then why the notifier?  Why
not put the code in exynos_suspend_enter() ?  Why add this needless
complexity?
