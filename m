Overall the idea and the patch look good to me.

Calling pm_runtime_get for prepare and pm_runtime_put for unprepared
makes perfect sense to me. It means that the power domain that powers
that clock hardware must be on for that clock to function properly.

It=E2=80=99s worth pointing out that this patch leaves that power domain en=
abled
for for as long as prepare_count is greater than zero.

However the rate-change operations only use the pm_runtime functions to
program the hardware and modify the registers. At the end of each
rate-change call there is a pm_runtime_put. This makes sense to me, but
I=E2=80=99m trying to wrap my head around the fact that this patch introduc=
es
two behaviors:

1) protect access to the clk hardware by wrapping writes across the bus
with pm_runtime calls
2) power the clock logic when the clock is in use (e.g. clk_prepare())

Everything about this patch *seems* correct to me, but I=E2=80=99m trying to
figure out what it means to for a clock consumer driver to do something
like this:

clk_prepare_enable()
clk_disable_unprepare()
clk_set_rate()

Maybe patches #2-5 will help me understand, but I wanted to jot this
down in my review before I forget.

I wonder if the above can be moved inside of __clk_core_init?
clk_register shouldn't manage any clk_ops directly, only __clk_core_init
does this.
