This power-on-gpio should indeed be handled by the regulator, but the regulator 
cannot be handled by the PCIe device driver. This power-on-gpio must be operated 
on per-slot basis if I understand it correctly, so it cannot be controlled by 
the host controller driver either.

The reason why this cannot be controlled by the device driver is that if the 
device is powered down, it won't be detected on the PCIe bus, thus it cannot 
enable the regulator which will power up the slot the device is sitting in.

btw. am I blind or do I just not see devicetree-discuss on CC ?
