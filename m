Agree.

While I was searching for drivers that behave as in scenario 5), they
tend to register some subsystem specific callbacks and don't access
the device until some of those callbacks are invoked.

At least that was my interpretation of their ->probe() methods, but
it's not always easy to tell how those callbacks are being used for
each subsystem.

I get your point and agree!

The late_initcall doesn't work for modules.

Also, suppose the PM domain only holds this "inactive device" that was
probed as in scenario 5). Then, you could end up having the PM domain
powered, even if it isn't needed.

Anyway, I can live with this. It's likely the driver that behave as in
scenario 5) that should be fixed as you stated.

Considering that scenario 5) probably exists because of buggy drivers
and that the related issues is very limited, I am perfectly fine with
your proposal!

Will you queue this patch then?

Kind regards
