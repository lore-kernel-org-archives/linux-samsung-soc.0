linux-prefixed properties are a big red flag. The device tree should describe
the hardware, not what linux does with the hardware.

See previous comments about "support-8bit" for encoding exactly the same
hardware capability in a linux-agnostic way. What the sdhci driver chooses to
do with it is up to the driver, and in some cases it means it will set the
capabilities flag.

Same goes for the other properties. It should not go in as it is
implemented in this patch, it needs to be fixed up.
