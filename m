No, that's not how Kconfig interprets it. There are many bool option
that depend on tristate options but can be enabled if the dependency
is built-in.

Take this one for example:

config FIRMWARE_EDID
       bool "Enable firmware EDID"
       depends on FB

We clearly want to be able to turn this on even for FB=m.

No, this is not runtime tested. Generally there is very little that
can go wrong here though.

An alternative would be to change the dependency to

	depends on BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE=y

which doesn't allow the driver to be turned on for the =m case.
However, no other framebuffer driver does this.

The original Makefile would link each file into a separate module, but that
cannot work, because they reference symbols from each other that are not
exported to other modules.

With my change, all the files get linked into a single module.
