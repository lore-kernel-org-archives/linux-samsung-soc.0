No, not yet. I have not made that change yet. I just asked that question
in patch 2. I still remove individually but wanted to know if removing
dynamic opp is any issue ?

The OPP added using dev_pm_opp_add are marked dynamic and are not
deleted by dev_pm_opp_{,cpumask_}remove_table. If it does, then
scpi_free_opp_table can be assigned that instead of what I have in patch
2/2.

Sure once you agree and I make that change  ;)
