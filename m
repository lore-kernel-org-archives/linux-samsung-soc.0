Thanks for the looking at this.

Even GIC is not masking any interrupt on suspend and if other irqchip or
drivers are assuming that, it will work fine for now. But once I
introduce that change in GIC it will break.

No issues, I just wanted to understand the issue better and also make
sure we understand that things might break in future once that GIC
change is introduced. So we already know the reason or atleast have some
basic understanding as why would it break if it breaks :)

As I said I am fine with this patch for now and I don't want to block it.
