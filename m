Changes since v2:
- Patch 3/4 is a new patch in this series. The real6410 and mini6410 boards
  use the display controllers window configuration data to represent video
  timing of two different lcd panels. Since the window configuration data
  should be not be used to specify timing of two different panels, this has
  been reworked in such a way that two instance of display controller's
  platform data is setup for the two supported lcd panels. Depending on the
  lcd panel specified using boot parameters, the corresponding platform data
  is registered. This maintains backward compatibility with existing
  functionality of supporting multiple lcd panels at runtime.

Changes since v1:
- Includes all changes suggested by Jingoo Han.
- Reworked s3c-fb platform data in all Samsung SoC based board files.

This patchset rearranges the elements in the platform data of the s3c-fb
driver with the intent of adding device tree support to the driver in
subsequent patches.

The first patch moves the video timing information from the individual window
setup data into the platform specific configuration section in the platform
data. The video timing is independent of the window setup. The resolution of
the window could be smaller than that of the lcd panel attached. So the video
timing data is removed from window configuration data.

The second patch removes the need for the 'default_win' element in the
platform data. This element was used to decide whether the video data
output from the controller should be enabled or disabled when the window
specified by 'default_win' is enabled or disabled. With the first patch
removing the need for atleast one window to be of the same resolution as
that of the lcd panel, it is now possible to decide when to enable/disable
the video data output based on the state of each window. If any of the
window is active, the lcd data output is enabled. Otherwise, the lcd data
output is disabled. Hence, the 'default_win' parameter from the platform
data can be removed, which anyways cannot be specified when using
device tree.

The third patch reworks the display controller's platform data that was
used to supply video timing information for two different panels on the
mini6410 and real6410 boards. That was not the correct usage of the window
data and hence reworks the runtime handling of two different lcd panels.

For all the Samsung SoC based boards, the forth patch reworks the platform
data of the display controller based on the changes introduced in the first
two patches.

This patch series is based on
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kgene/linux-samsung.git [for-next]

with all patches merged from
https://github.com/schandinat/linux-2.6.git [fbdev-next]

and tested one Exynos4210 based Origen board (only compile tested for
other boards)
