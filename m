Ok I don't know exactly the values but I am a bit surprised by this
small value. When I measured the power consumption with a core offline
it saved roughly 100mA (AFAIR). Of course, there is no dynamic with the
hotplugging but there is really a big difference here.

With another board with similar hardware (but a different SoC), just
putting the cores in retention mode in the cpuidle drivers saved 13mA.

Is it possible for the exynos board, the target residency is too large
for AFTR mode ? Is this value really resulting from a measurement or
just put there arbitrarily ? And, may be, it does not enter enough in
this state to have a significant power saving.

Yes but unfortunately this approach has been nacked by the community
last year with the OMAP4.
