but in case of wait_for_completion_killable_timeout it also would return
-ERESTARTSYS (unless I'm missreading do_wait_for_common -> signal_pending_state(state, current)) so I still think it would be better to have the
dev_warn() in the path and then when the task is killed it atleast leaves
some trace of the of what was going on ?

yup - as was noted in the patch - and this is also why it was
not really possible to figure out what should really be done
as it runs into a dead end in all cases - the only point of the patch was
to atleast generate a debug message and return some signal
indicating error ... which is then unhandled...

there is plenty of this - actually all of the wait_for_completion* related
findings I've been posting in the past 2 month are based on the attempt to
write up a more or less complete API spec in form of coccinelle scripts that
then can be used to scan and sometimes fix-up this kind of problems - but of
course just "local-fixes" - this can't fix fundamentally broken code.

thx!
