Sure, they can be, but the question is who would even want to call them 
this way? We are on kernel level, we have assumptions here and we don't 
break those assumptions.

Again, who would be willing to do something like this? We are not in 
userspace.

Sure, it wouldn't. If I'm not mistaken, I already acomplished this in one 
or two of the versions I posted long time ago, but was it really worth all 
the added drawbacks?

Keep in mind that originally, when I started my work on this, I thought 
exactly the same as you - let's design something scalable and sane. 
However, sometimes it's necessary to ask the question if that's really 
what is needed.

This was just a proposal. Do you want anything else to be added to the 
comment or anything to be changed?

Sure, an alternative would be getting rid of the hacky shared spinlock, 
but do we really need that? Do we really want to have something in the 
kernel that we don't need? I'm just trying to avoid this.

Best regards,
