I labored at naming. Isn't it proper? :)
Do you have any recommendation?
group_pack_req?

=2E.. cases where CMD23 is not supported and we send packed commands?
Packed command must not be allowed in such a case.
It works only with predefined mode which is essential fator.
And spec doesn't mentioned PACKED_EVENT_EN must be set.
So Packed command can be sent regardless PACKED_EVENT_EN,
but it's not complete without reporting of error.
Then host driver may suffer error recovery.
Why packed command is used without error reporting?

In the case where reliable write is request but enhanced reliable write
is not supported, write access must be partial according to
reliable write sector count. Because even a single request can be split=
,
packed command is not allowed in this case.

Yes, it would be another interesting approach.
Command packing you mentioned means gathering request among same direct=
ion(read/write)?
Currently I/O scheduler may know device constrains which MMC driver inf=
orms
with the exception of order information for packed command.
But I think the dependency of I/O scheduler may be able to come up.
How can MMC layer treat packed command with I/O scheduler which doesn't=
 support this?

At the first time, I considered that way.
I'll do more, if possible.

Right, I missed it.

This part is not only the new but also origin code which is moved in th=
is patch.
Maybe...,'If' case is used  for a whole of remained bytes and
'while' case is used for partial report of remained bytes.

Thank you for review.
