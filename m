Patchset applied cleanly with:
1. Removal of blank lines at end of two files (they appeared in v7).
2. Removal of your tested-by. The author does not provide such tag
because it is assumed that he tested it before sending. However I left
the information about testing platform near your signed-off-by.

You can find the patches on the same branch:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/krzk/linux.git/log/?h=next/stuff-late-not-split-per-branch

I hope I will be able to push it out to arm-soc soon...

Best regards,
Krzysztof
