I'm back from holidays with access to the machine again so I was able to look
at your issue.

So my assumptions was correct and the issue is that the kernel disables the
resources (clocks and regulators) needed to have display working and because
the simplefb expects the display hardware to have been already initialized by
the bootloader/firmware, it simply fails.

You didn't face this issue before 3.15 because the default bootargs set by
nv_uboot-snow already includes the "clk_ignore_unused" parameter and the
kernel didn't know about the regulators but the later changed with commit:

b16be76 ("ARM: dts: add tps65090 power regulator for exynos5250-snow")

This was included in 3.16, so the mentioned commit is what "broke" your
workflow since now the kernel is aware of the tps65090 fet1 and fet6
regulators (used as supply for the the backlight and panel respectively) and
disables them because nothing uses them from a kernel POV.

You will have the same issue even  with 3.15 if you don't pass the
"clk_ignore_unused" parameter to the kernel command line.

The sunxi folks faced the same issue and tried to solve it by making the
simplefb driver to claim the needed resources thus preventing the kernel to
disable them due not used. But that spawn the very long thread [0] mentioned
above and I've zero interest in joining that discussion...

So, following is a workaround patch [1] that just forces the needed regulators
to be always-on but I don't think this is the proper solution. The right thing
to do IMHO is to use the needed Exynos DRM/KMS patches as Ajay mentioned
before since AFAIU the simplefb is only to have a frame-buffer console working
on platforms where a KMS/DRM driver is not available yet.

But maybe we could add a boot argument similar to "clk_ignore_unused" but for
regulators? Something like "regulator_ignore_unused" that would prevent the
regulator core to disable unused regulators? If Mark agrees with that idea
I'll be glad to propose a patch.

Best regards,
Javier

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] ARM: dts: prevent exynos5250-snow display regulators to
 be disabled

The tps65090 fet1 and fet6 regulators are used in the Exynos5250
based Snow as power supplies for the PWM backlight and LCD panel
respectively. The bootloader enables those regulators in order to
have display working but the kernel still doesn't support the eDP
to LVDS bridge used in the Snow and the display device nodes are
not present in the Device Tree so these regulators are disabled.

The problem is that the simple frame-buffer driver can't be used
anymore since this driver assumes that the display hardware has
been initialized before the kernel boots and does not claim any
needed resources (regulators, clocks, etc) so the subsystems
disabled them if they are not used.

This used to work before just because support for the tps65090
PMU was not present in the DT so the kernel didn't know about it.
