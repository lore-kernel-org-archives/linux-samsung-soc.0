I deliberately didn't use the "DT ABI break" expression since as you said is
not part of the documented DT bindings. But what I said is that this change
will break old DTBs with newer kernels since reboot and power off will stop
working after $SUBJECT.

I'm not a particular fan of the stable DT idea since in practice it seems to
do more harm than good but since that was decided, the expectation for users
is that booting a new kernel with an old DT should not cause any regression.

So I think that at least a comment in the commit message is needed so if
there are people really using old DTs with newer kernels on Exynos boards,
they can know that the commit causes such an issue instead of having to
figure it out themselves.

Agreed, Kconfig circular dependencies is the reason why select is avoided.
Fortunately now the 0-day bot analyzes even posted patches so it's possible
that such an issue could be found even before these patches are merged.
