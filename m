There's an default_onfi_timing_mode in the nand_flash_dev struct. You
can define a full-id for your NAND chip in the nand-ids table if you
want. Otherwise, this means you'll have to use ONFI timing mode 0
(which should work for all NANDs).

Note that we've recently introduced a generic interface [1] to let NAND
controllers configure the timings, and let the core select the best
timings based on the information it has (ONFI, JEDEC or the nand-ids
table).

Well, no, it does not make any sense. What could have a sense is
enabling ECC on some partitions, but not on others, but that's not
supported right now (actually, I tried to add support for that once,
but it was not accepted).

Do you really need that? I mean, is the platform you're trying to
convert to DT using this property in its platform_data objects?

I'd recommend to drop this property until we figure what it's really
used for.

It's the right approach, indeed.
