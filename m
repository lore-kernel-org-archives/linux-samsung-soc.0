It's different issue and I agree with Mark Brown's comments.

Well, I don't think so, because Samsung is no more just SoC vendor. 
Actually Samsung is providing just IP to customers, I think, they don't 
like to use the name, exynos**** for their SoC or Chip, because exynos, 
s3c or s5p whatever is Samsung's SoC brand name. If so, I think, my 
suggestion is more reasonable. See the example of Synopsys and ARM 
primecell...that's why I will try to do it. But I know I need to get 
agreement from DT guys and maybe I need more time than I expect ;-)
