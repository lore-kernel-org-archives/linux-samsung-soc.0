[1.] One line summary of the problem: "BUG: sleeping function called 
from invalid context at mm/slub.c:1250" after CPU hotplug
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:

This was tested on Exynos 3250 board with 
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/24/441 applied. Board is booting to 
/bin/sh. After executing:

mount -t sysfs sys /sys && echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online 
&& echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

I'm getting:

The problem is that request_irq is calling allocation with GFP_KERNEL 
flag in atomic block.
This bug should be easy observable on any board with 
"samsung,exynos4210-mct" compatible MCT block.

[4.1.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
3.17.0
[4.2.] Kernel .config file:
exynos_defconfig + DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP and DEBUG_PREEMPT

[7.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
      problem (if possible)
mount -t sysfs sys /sys && echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online 
&& echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
[8.] Environment
/bin/sh

When SoC have MCT_INT_SPI interrupt it is being allocated after 
hotplugging of the CPU, secondary_start_kernel() is sending CPU boot 
notifications which are send when preemption and interrupts are 
disabled. Exynos_mct notification handler tries to set up and allocate 
IRQ for SPI type interrupt for started CPU and then BUG appears.
There might be similar problem on qcom-timer I think just after looking 
on the code.
