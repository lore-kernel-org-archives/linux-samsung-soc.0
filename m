I had been keeping them separate on the basis that we don't want changes to
support new T100 features to cause regressions in the old T9 handling. But
there is a fair amount of duplication as you say, probably worth addressing.

FWIW I have a queue of stuff that might be considered higher priority, the
next 15-patch set would be up to "add regulator control support":
https://github.com/ndyer/linux/compare/dtor:next...for-dtor

It does cause me some issues to merge upstream refactorings past that lot...
