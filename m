Okay, I take your point.

When the runtime PM core invokes a power domain's callback routine,
what does the domain's routine usually do?  Does it go ahead and invoke
the driver's callback?  Or does it try to invoke the subsystem's
callback?

Obviously this depends on how the power domain code is written.  But
suppose every power domain would always use the same strategy as the PM
core: Invoke the subsystem's callback if there is one; otherwise invoke
the driver's callback.

Then there wouldn't be a problem.  Even when a runtime-resume went via
the power domain, the subsystem would still be able to protect the
not-yet-bound driver from being called.

(... Unless the subsystem itself was incapable of doing this the right 
way.  But subsystems can be fixed.)
