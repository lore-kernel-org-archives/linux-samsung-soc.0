Sorry for late reply as I was off for vacation.
Yes we need 2 trip points of type THERMAL_TRIP_STATE_INSTANCE as we
need different cooling for these 2 zones. Anyways Do you feel that
these whole/partial patch series(cpufreq cooling api's, new trip  type
etc) is ack-able or some modification is needed?
