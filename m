Could you please give some more details about these issues?

If this is a build breakage for CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=n && CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y
configuration then this is not a new problem introduced by the current
patchset (please see below).

Even without Daniel's patchset we are getting a link error for
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP=n && CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y configuration.

In arch/arm/mach-exynos/Makefile we have:

...
obj-$(CONFIG_PM_SLEEP)		+= pm.o sleep.o
...
obj-$(CONFIG_CPU_IDLE)		+= cpuidle.o
...

and since cpuidle.c is referencing exynos_cpu_resume() from sleep.S
the build results in:

arch/arm/kernel/return_address.c:63:2: warning: #warning "TODO: return_address should use unwind tables" [-Wcpp]
arch/arm/mach-exynos/built-in.o: In function `exynos4_enter_core0_aftr':
/home/bzolnier/linux-sprc/arch/arm/mach-exynos/cpuidle.c:141: undefined reference to `cpu_suspend'
arch/arm/mach-exynos/built-in.o: In function `exynos4_enter_lowpower':
/home/bzolnier/linux-sprc/arch/arm/mach-exynos/cpuidle.c:176: undefined reference to `exynos_cpu_resume'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

linkage errors.

[ The other error for the current code is for cpu_suspend() which is
  also (indirectly) dependent on CONFIG_PM_SLEEP. ]

Agreed but this can be fixed trivially (even in in the incremental
patch).

Moreover this code is not going to be shared between arm32 and arm64 in
the near future (if ever) and doing things by using platform device
has such benefit that the current code can be changed without a problem
when the need arise.  With DT there is no such flexibility and it also
takes some time to design DT bindings properly.

The build problems should be fixed but if indeed they are not a new ones
then the patchset should be brought back (Kukjin has dropped it entirely
for now).  This is important work which serves as a base for more cpuidle
improvements from both Daniel and me therefore it would be great to have
it merged in v3.16 and not delay it unnecessarily.
