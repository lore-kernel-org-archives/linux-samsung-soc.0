Right, for some reason I thought that Andreas' rebased patches ended
in for-next but now I see that are in next/late as well so yes, those
patches are not required for 3.18.

Sorry for the noise then, -ETOOMANYBRANCHES

The Snow/Peach rtc_src clk for s3c-rtc patches are still needed on
those platforms since the S3C RTC uses the Maxim 77802 32kHz AP clock
as its source clock and this will be disabled by the common clock
framework if are not used.

In practice, most people using mainline are booting with a U-Boot
version that passes the clk_ignore_unused parameter to the kernel
command line so if Marek's patch makes for the 3.18 rc cycle, the
Snow/Peach rtc_src patches can indeed wait for 3.19.

Best regards,
Javier
