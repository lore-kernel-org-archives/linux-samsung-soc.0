Thanks Ulf, I've tested this patch on top of v3.18-rc3 on Exynos4412 Trats2
board and it seems the unbalanced runtime_suspend() call issue is gone.

I had some issues with such configuration, after modifying the drivers to
call pm_runtime_set_active() (instead of pm_runtime_get_sync()) in probe().
It looked like there is some access to the hardware with corresponding
power domain disabled. Couldn't debug it in reasonable time due to system
hanging, will try to get back to this on Wednesday.

And with that additional patch series and the drivers modified everything
seemed to work too.

The patch looks good to me as a fix for v3.18, if others don't report
regressions feel free to add my:
