I feel like there is no actual use case for that though origin Synopsys IP supports.
Multi-slot  might be not useful in terms of performance because shared bus should be allowed.
(At least this is the way I see it, though)
As Exynos's host does so, other hosts which are introduced in Linux seems use one card per host.
If it's really not found now, I could agree on this topic.
