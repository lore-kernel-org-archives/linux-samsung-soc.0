Is that even possible? Every device should be in some power
domain, even if it's just an "always on" power domain that we
don't really control from software.

I don't get this part. Do you mean how we indicate to the driver
which power domain to use at the right time?

Right. Runtime PM will need to be improved to allow this case.

Ok. From a DT perspective the sub-nodes seem to be a workaround
for how the linux device model is mapped to power domains. I'm
not sure we want to make subnodes in the clk controller just to
make sub devices that we can target from the clk registration
path. Those sub nodes aren't devices at all. I understand why
it's being done this way, I just don't see how it fits into DT
design methodologies.
