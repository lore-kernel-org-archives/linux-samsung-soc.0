And I would strongly argue that you just need to update your tslib,
especially given the fact that this issue was dealt with there about a
year ago.  And if you really need that fix to be in released (read
'tagged') version of tslib - please speak to its maintainer.

Why everyone thinks that it is a good idea to pile workarounds for
software issues in the kernel but updating the other parts of software
stack is a big no-no?
