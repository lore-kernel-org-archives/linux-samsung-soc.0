Matrix encoding is too complicated; my brain froze when trying to decode
the message above.  I favor properties that can be understood in
isolation.  The following proberties are mutually-exclusive.

<no properties present>: The standard SDHCI register bit just works.  No
additional setup is necessary (either the system is hardwired to work
correctly or external software has already done any necessary setup).

broken-cd <no value>: CD is just not available - neither via the
standard SDHCI register bit/interrupt, nor by an external GPIO.

cd-gpios <&gpio, active_low> : The standard SDHCI register bit does not
work, but CD is available via the specified GPIO.  If active_low is 0,
reading 1 from the GPIO pin means that the card is present, otherwise
reading 0 from the GPIO pin means that the card is present.  I must
emphasize that this is an external GPIO, accessed via GPIO mechanisms,
not a connection of a multipurpose pin to the SDHCI core.

cd-pin <&pin> : The standard SDHCI register bit works, but the SDHCI
driver must ask for the indicated multipurpose pin to be connected to
the SDHCI controller as the CD pin.  I don't know what &pin is, exactly,
as I haven't been paying attention to the pinmux discussions.
