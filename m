Yes they would, although they require some minor additional adaptations.

Those resources that are enabled from the driver's runtime PM resume
callback, should also be enabled during ->probe(). The
pm_runtime_set_active() will then update the state to reflect this.

Then, if CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is enabled - the device will be scheduled
to go inactive from driver core (pm_request_idle()), after ->probe()
has completed. Thus saving power if it's unused.
If CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME isn't enabled - the driver will still be
functional, since all resources are enabled during ->probe().

Kind regards
Uffe
