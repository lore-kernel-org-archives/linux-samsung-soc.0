I have nothing against combining the parameters that way. I think the
important thing here is just that we have to allow changing of the
parameters, whenever the display device needs that. So the bus
parameters cannot be a one time constant setting.

Well, now, that's the question.

Let's consider a simplified case with DSI output from the SoC, and a DSI
panel. If the panel is a rather simple one, you could well call a method
in the API in the DSI output driver, which would do necessary
configuration and inform the panel driver to do any configuration it
needs to do, based on the parameters.

However, in my experience display devices, DSI devices in particular,
are often quite "interesting". If the control of the operation in
question is in the DSI output side, we are limited about what kind of
DSI panels we can use, as the DSI output driver has to know all the
tricks needed to make the panels work.

I'm having hard time trying to explain this, so let's try an example.
Consider the initial powering up of the bus. If the DSI output driver is
in control, something like the following probably happens:

- output driver asks for the parameters from the panel driver
- output driver programs the DSI output according to these parameters
- output driver informs the panel that the bus is now up and running

Then consider a totally invented case, but which perhaps describes the
problem with the above approach: The DSI panel requires the DSI bus
first to be started in HS mode, but with a certain predefined bus speed,
and only one lane used. This predefined bus setup is used to send
configuration commands to the panel hardware, and only after that can
you reconfigure the bus with proper speed and lanes.

That kind of thing is a bit difficult to manage with the DSI output
driver is in control. However, if the DSI panel driver is in control,
it's simple:

- panel driver calls config methods in the DSI output driver, setting
the predefined speed and one lane
- panel driver sends configuration commands to the panel
- panel driver calls config methods in the DSI output driver, setting
the final bus config

In OMAP you can configure the DSI pins quite freely. We have the
following struct:

struct omap_dsi_pin_config {
	int num_pins;
	/*
	 * pin numbers in the following order:
	 * clk+, clk-
	 * data1+, data1-
	 * data2+, data2-
	 * ...
	 */
	int pins[OMAP_DSS_MAX_DSI_PINS];
};
