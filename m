Hi Shuah,

Do you have a bit of spare time for Exynos kernel development? Could you 
investigate why Peach-Pi(t) Chromebooks fails to boot with recent 
kernels? If I remember correctly, you had access to those boards.

The failure itself seems to be caused by the following patch: 
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10067711/ which got merged as 
510353a63796 to v4.15-rc3 and fixed the boot issue on Snow Chromebook 
(Exynos 5250 based).
However I don't see any path how it might deadlock and cause boot 
failure on Exynos 5420/5800 Chromebooks. I don't have access to Peach 
Chromebooks to reproduce and our Snow works fine.

Here are some logs:
v4.15-rc3 failure:
https://storage.kernelci.org/mainline/master/v4.15-rc3/arm/exynos_defconfig/lab-collabora/boot-exynos5800-peach-pi.html
next-20171207 first next failure:
https://storage.kernelci.org/next/master/next-20171207/arm/exynos_defconfig/lab-collabora/boot-exynos5800-peach-pi.html

Here is a report on the first boot failure in linux-next:
