As Bjorn mentioned earlier, I agree with this option.

But, if possible, I prefer this option.
I am not sure that it cannot make the code dirty.
Maybe, you need to discuss with hardware design engineers.

When I submitted the pci-exynos.c, there was no PHY generic framework.
But, currently, using PHY generic framework is mandatory, as other PCIe host
driver did.
I think that we should use PHY generic framework for new SoCs.

'Block' is very specific registers for 5440.
Other Exynos SoCs do not use that registers.
Actually, it is not the same with 'syscon'.
But, you can assume 'block' as 'syscon'.
