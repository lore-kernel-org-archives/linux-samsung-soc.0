I think you are referring old manual. 3-bit is right.
I hope you find this.

Yes, clock divisor is used in Exynos5250.
In case of Exynos4 SoC's, divider value(DIVRATIO) isn't exposed to register.
But  SDCLKIN is divided by fixed divider value internally.
As mentioned previously, divider is used like below.
Exynos4210 : 2
Exynos4X12 : 4

Is there any basis for these value which you chose?
If these can be acceptable for the most part, we can consider it for default value.
But it depends on host of SOC and target board.
