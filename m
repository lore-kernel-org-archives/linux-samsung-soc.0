My answer is not "use mainline u-boot" primarily because I am not sure
mainline u-boot actually works on 5420 :). My answer is keep a patch
locally (or make a trivial change to the bootcmd) for people who would
like to use an upstream kernel with the firmware on the device. Once
we do have a working mainline u-boot, that can then be used by the
interested parties.

I think there is some confusion here, the clearing of the iRAM
location is what I have been pushing against. It has got nothing to do
cpuidle. If it were to be done then  it would be a one time setup and
I could quite easily do it in mcpm_init.
