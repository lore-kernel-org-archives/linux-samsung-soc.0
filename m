Honestly, I'm no longer amused.

Sorry, but this is utter nonsense.

CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset means "no runtime PM at all", so all drivers can expect
everything they need to be always on.  If that is not the case, then someone is
doing runtime PM behind the scenes and therefore cheating.  Or in different
words, for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset bus types, platforms etc must ensure that
everything is on from the drivers' perspective.

If that is the case, then calling pm_runtime_get_sync() from ->probe
for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unset simply doesn't matter.

Now, for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME enabled, if power domains are in use, doing
pm_runtime_get_sync() from ->probe is the only way the driver can ensure
in a non-racy way that the device will be accessible going forward.

Why?  Simply because the probing need not happen during system initialization.
It very well may take places when the other devices in the same domain have
beein in use for quite a while and have been using runtime PM (in which
case the domain may go off at any time unless it is explicityly prevented from
doing that).

One thing that you may be missing is that, for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set,
runtime PM has to be either enabled or disabled for all devices in one
domain (and if it is disabled, then the domain needs to be always on for
all practical purposes).  Otherwise you can't just make all of them happy
at the same time.  The documentation doesn't cover this, because it had been
written before we even started to consider power domains.

So please go to Documentation/power/runtime_pm.txt and read it again.  Quote:

"If the default initial runtime PM status of the device (i.e. 'suspended')
reflects the actual state of the device, its bus type's or its driver's
->probe() callback will likely need to wake it up using one of the PM core's
helper functions described in Section 4.  In that case, pm_runtime_resume()
should be used.  Of course, for this purpose the device's runtime PM has to be
enabled earlier by calling pm_runtime_enable()."

So how is this in agreement with what you're saying, I wonder?

And how the heck can a driver (whose device belongs to a power domain) be sure
that the device is "fully powered and capable of handling I/O" duing ->probe()?

Which looks like reiterating the same incorrect arguments.

Which may not work if power domains are involved.

There seems to be a lot of confusion around this, so let me summarize:

- For CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME unsed drivers should be able to *safely* assume
  that they can access devices at any time.  All of the runtime PM helpers
  don't matter then (up to the error codes returned).

- For CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set, if power domains are in use, then runtime PM
  has to be either enabled or disabled for all devices in one domain (and
  if disabled, the expected behavior is like the above).

- For CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set, if power domains are in use, drivers (or bus
  types etc) should not make any assumptions about devices being fully
  powered without ensuring that this is the case, usually by holding an
  active PM runtime reference to the device before accessing it.

Now, there may be places in the core/bus type code that aren't aligned with
the above, so they need to be fixed this way or another.

HTH,
Rafael
