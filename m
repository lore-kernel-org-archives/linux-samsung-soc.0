Interesting, thanks a lot for sharing this information.

Can you share the patches you are using to turn on the DISP1 power domain
since AFAIU the kernel does not know about the DISP1 power domain after
commit d51cad7df871 ("ARM: dts: remove display power domain for exynos5420").

I tried reverting that commit before so the kernel knows about the DISP1
power domain and booting with pd_ignore_unused but still had the stripes.

Something that is not clear to me is how display panel is working on the
Peach boards if this is a power domain issue since according to the manual
both the modules used for display (LCD controller and DP) and the modules
used for HDMI (MIXER and HDMI) belong to the same power domain (DISP1).

Or am I misunderstanding something? 

Thanks a lot for your help and best regards,
Javier
