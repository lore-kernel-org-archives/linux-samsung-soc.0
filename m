I don't understand. I didn't enable it manually and
I still get it on linux-next-20130107. Maybe you were
still on the older linux-next that had not been updated
for some time?

I just tried building with "make allmodconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=allconfig",
with the allconfig file containing a CONFIG_MACH_S3C2410=y statement.
This caught a number of additionl problems, some related and some not.

True. What is actually the bigger worry here is that the contents
of the new file, while correctly moved out of mach/gpio.h also
don't belong into include/linux/platform_data, because they don't
define a pdata structure but rather the contents that are supposed
to be passed from the platform code. I would much prefer if you could
move the file back into mach-s3c24xx/ under a new name and keep it out of
platform_data. I suspect that the only thing actually needed by the
gpio driver is the number of GPIO lines per platform, and we can
find another way to communicate that. Most of the contents should
be private to the mach-s3c code and not be visible to either the
gpio driver or any drivers using the plat/gpio-cfg.h interface.

But exynos was using this driver before it moved to the new pinctrl
driver.
