Need investigation.

What is the exynos board version where that occurs ?

It is handled by the hardware, for the exynos it should be the PMU. The
CPU stays clock/power gated and when an interrupt occurs the PMU wakes
up the CPU. This one continue its instructions after cpu_do_idle and
right after enables the local interrupts leading to the interrupt handl=
ing.

No I can't, no spare time for that and furthermore this work has alread=

be done by Amit Daniel when he submitted the driver.

Amit Daniel is no longer a Linaro assignee but it is still part of the
Samsung company (changed the email address to reach him).

It is useless to do that. This work is already done.

The kernel is not a playground where you can upstream code and then
remove it because a feature seems broken and you don't have an idea of =
why.

I asked several times the reasons of why the AFTR state couldn't work
with multiple CPUs and I had no answer.

=46rankly speaking I have a couple of hypothesis:

1. something is not correctly setup and the PMU does not wake up the CP=
U1
2. there is a silicon bug and no one wants to tell it is the case

In any case, this must be investigated and identified. And then we can
take a decision about this state.
