I guess spatch would need some patching to deal with this.. I tried
with something like:

@r@
identifier I, s, fld;
position p0,p;
expression E;
@@

struct I s =@p0 {
...
-       .fld@p = E,
+       .fld = E,
...
};

That catches them, but adds an extra comma in the beginning :)

And it also messes up the formatting for other structs..

Anyways, I think I got most of these fixed for all ARM subarchitectures
in a pile of 72 patches, the stats are: 

486 files changed, 2296 insertions(+), 2296 deletions(-)

This is something people can then use as a base to start chipping away at
the problem. I'm thinking it may be possible to use this as a base for
search and replacement type work and then hopefully git mergetool will
pick the relevant changes when rebasing a working branch to the mainline.

I can also post the patches here if people want, but sounds like we're
not going to merge them as they are, but instead will slowly fix the
issue in other related patches?

I've pushed the patches into a git branch at:
