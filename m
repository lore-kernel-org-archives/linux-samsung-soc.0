Actually it looks kind a similar to issue with adma/mau_epll clocks:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/12/5/291

In that case runtime PM for pl330 caused adma clock to be gated. This
lead to gating its parent clock - mau_epll. The clock hierarchy is
strange for maudio domain. Basically mau_epll is needed to access
maudio clocks however these clocks are not children of mau_epll.

I think we should not enable the mdma0 but instead we should find the
proper parent which needs to be enabled.

Anyway it is kind of annoying (or funny if one has sense of black
humour) that two issues are exposed by runtime PM for pl330 driver.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
