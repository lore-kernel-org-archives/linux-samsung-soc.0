I am not sure how is including the firmware in a ramdisk going to
improve things over including it in my root filesystem. As far as I am
aware it does not make any difference for the kernel.

The firmware is not included in the kernel tree nor configured as
extra firmware option in the defconfig, either. Otherwise the firmware
loader would supposedly find the firmware and we would not have this
discussion.

The mwifiex driver is configured as built-in in the defconfig so what
happens when the driver is built as a module is not relevant for this
defconfig.

I'm booting Debian Jessie as well and for me WiFi is not working
without CFG80211_WEXT for another example.

So it might be that some tools have migrated to another interface but
at first glance I have no idea what those tools might be in Debian so
for me the WiFi is unusable without wireless extensions.

Do you have some specific suggestions about improvements to the commit message?

Thanks
