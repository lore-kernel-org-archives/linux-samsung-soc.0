by coincidence, I have just looked at the same driver in order to
add support for s3c24xx and s3c64xx, so we can remove the plat-samsung
adc framework they still use.  Those changes would naturally conflict
with yours, but I think it makes sense for your patches to come first.

I'll comment a bit more on the individual patches. I didn't have
interest in them earlier, so I didn't comment so far.

Another aspect that came up is the touchscreen support. Right now,
there is drivers/input/touchscreen/s3c2410_ts.c which is intimately
tied to arch/arm/plat-samsung/adc.c. The best way forward (as discussed
on IRC as few days ago) seems to be to integrate support for that into
the exynos_adc driver. Can you comment on which parts actually support
touchscreen? Did touchscreen support get dropped in the exynos hardware,
or is the driver just missing at the moment?
