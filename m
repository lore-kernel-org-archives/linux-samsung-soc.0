Hi Mark.

I know that used with the same driver on other Samsung-SoCs(S3C64XX/S3C=
24XX..etc)
I just only used the interface in sdhci-pltfm.c. Nothing difference..
Why do you think that will break the other SoC?

Header file(/plat/regs-sdhci.h) also is only used in sdhci-s3c.c.
And the least portion is moved into /linux/mmc/.=20
Then included "linux/mmc/sdhci-s3c.h" in plat/sdhci.h.

What's difference?=20
If you can explain the more detail, i can understand.
But sorry, now i didn't accept your opinion.

Best Regards,
