I will try to test this on Exynos 4 at work, if I somehow manage to find 
any way to use PWM on our boards (other than already-tested PWM 
clocksource).

Unfortunately, except S3C6410, I don't have access to other platforms, or 
at least I won't in any reasonable time.

If I remember correctly, in case of my watchdog support cleanup, Kukjin 
has been able to test it on S5P64x0.

Heiko and Sylwester used to have some s3c24xx-based boards, not sure if 
they still do and are interested in their support in mainline.

So all left is S5PC100 (for which I couldn't find anyone who cares) and 
Exynos5.

Thanks.

Yeah. Unfortunately all I could do was testing on Tiny6410 and compile 
testing on others. I hope we find some really helpful people over here who 
could waste a bit of their precious time for this museum. ;)

Best regards,
Tomasz
