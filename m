Hi Viresh/Jonghwan,

In the frequency table dts file, the frequencies are arranged in
descending order which maps 1 to 1 with other frequency parameter to
be calculated and programmed in some registers.
But the OPP library works by generating the frequencies in ascending
order which breaks the above logic. Ideally i should expect frequency
values in same order as what is supplied.
So OPP library should not change the order or should take input flags
flags like,
dev_pm_opp_init_cpufreq_table(TABLE_ORDER_ASCEND|
TABLE_ORDER_DESCEND|TABLE_ORDER_ORIGINAL )

Thanks,
Amit Daniel
