Hi Russell and everyone,

Sorry for late participation on this :(
I'm out of my office for biz. trip so it was hard to check my e-mail
and will be back to my country this weekend.

Anyway, I and my colleagues know what we have to do for Linux world.
And as I know, we are preparing some stuff for it so please don't
expect the worst :)

I should be back on this after discussing with my colleagues.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
