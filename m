Okay, makes sense. A partial solution would be to apply them with
status=disabled. After all it is still a valid description of a
hardware. However this would not bring much benefits anyway...

Beside the name of node I mentioned, please put all the power domains
sorted to each other by address. I see the big picture here:
https://git.linaro.org/people/marek.szyprowski/linux-srpol.git/tree/arch/arm64/boot/dts/exynos/exynos5433.dtsi?h=v4.10-next-tm2-pd
and it does not looks ordered.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
