I would prefer not to, but I will if I need to.  As you say, adding a
spinlock to the IRQ handler will need to be tested heavily and I'm not
sure we're in the best position to do that.  I can send up the change
to use a spinlock with some minimal testing if you want, though.
...of perhaps Yuvaraj can since he's the one who's been sending this
patch upstream.

Note that the original change was quite hard to test.  The problem
would show up on certain boards easier than others and would show up
with certain revisions of the kernel but not with others.  In other
words: it was heavily timing dependent.  The current patch as-is has
been tested and shown to be stable for quite a while now.

Yup, there are a lot of different valid ways to accomplish the same
thing in the kernel.  ...but some of the ways drivers do things are
historical and are not the suggested way of doing things anymore.  I'm
still a kernel noob in many ways (despite a few years of working with
it), so I may be mistaken.

To me it feels like the interrupt + tasklet is effectively reinventing
threaded interrupts, but doing it in a custom way.
