Hello Christoffer,

Actually, on the Arndale you will find a few devices behind a SMMU,
including the MFC (codec) device, etc. I've tested MMAP and DMA
mapping functions for example, but the implementation is not yet
complete enough to fully use the device.

You can take a look into arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5250.dtsi for devices
with an iommu entry. Unfortunately, the Arndale is not a very well
documented board with regards to its peripherals...

Ideally, we would have access to a device that is simple and
documented enough, in order to write a trivial user space VFIO driver
to verify functionality. In practice, our options for validation are
limited, until we can finally fully assign a device at least.
