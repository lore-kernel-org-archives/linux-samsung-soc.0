Here is the entire set of clocksource and sched_clock patches which
have been previously posted.  There's a couple of small tweaks in a
few of the patches (such as adding notrace to OMAP clocksource read
functions), and this also shows the proper ordering of these patches.

Still looking for acks or tested-by's for these patches.
