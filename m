I can do it, but I rather not. My patches are based on the vendor kernel
by Hardkernel. But I'm not affiliated with with either Hardkernel nor
Samsung, so I have no access to the reference manual and no idea if the
frequencies and voltages are actually correct. I don't want to sign off
something which I can't verify to be correct...

I usually base patches on current torvalds/master, but I didn't bother
with this series since it's RFC and very much WIP. I don't think even
the devfreq bits cleanly apply. Anyway, I'm doing it properly once this
is out of RFC.



With best wishes,
Tobias
