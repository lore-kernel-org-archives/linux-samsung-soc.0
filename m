Hello Mr Kukjin,
          I checked this link
"http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg09770.html"
given by you,but this link has the patch only to extract the timeout
value from the
extended CSD register of the eMMC 4.5 device. Whereas if you review my =
patch
you can actually see the implementation of the timeout handling in the
mmc_switch
function in the mmc_ops.c

Sorry my previous mails were with ricj text enabled.
Thanks and regards
Girish K S
