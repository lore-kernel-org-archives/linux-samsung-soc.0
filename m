Dear Satya.
Keyslot manager is a good solution for ICE. And probably no issue for FMP.
But, I think it's complicated for FMP because FMP doesn't need
any keyslot control.
Crypto API that FMP's using is simply, stable, and supports test. 
FMP has been mass producing and certificating using crypto APIs
for several years. 
So I wants to keep  our current crypto API solution.
But, I'm looking at your patch.  And I will keep examining at your patch
because our goal is to run the FMP on the mainline kernel.

Thanks for your reply.
Boojin Kim.
