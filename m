This is trivial thing and should be fixed after my first reply. But
clearly we need to waste some more time... so I applied the patch to
check whether patchwork shows it properly or not... and it is the
same. Indentation is wrong.

Please fix the weird alignment. You have existing examples in the DTSI
file (rtc node) how to do it. Current indentation is clearly wrong -
why using spaces after tab if this is not aligned properly?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
