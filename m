I have being trying to change the trips temperature in the dts to some
higher values
in order to improve the performance of the board.
Here are the results under idle state and stress state.

root@odroidxu4n:~# cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp
58000
58000
61000
60000
56000
root@odroidxu4n:~# stress --vm 16 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10s
stress: info: [2138] dispatching hogs: 0 cpu, 0 io, 16 vm, 0 hdd
stress: info: [2138] successful run completed in 10s
root@odroidxu4n:~# cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp
58000
58000
61000
60000
56000

Which is too high for in idle state.

Second part of my testcase is the pm-qa from linaro.

[1] git://git.linaro.org/tools/pm-qa.git

pm-qa# make -C thermal check

I have observer in the testcase that their is use moderate heating of heat_cpu
get started by the testcase but it dose not get signal to kill on
exiting of the testcase.
most of these testcase failed to Odroid XU4, but the same case pass on
Odroid U3.

I have also tested with different e-fuse values [10,20,30,40] but the
results are same.

Going through the source code for HK it seen to set exynos_tmu_control
set more trigger level
