There is no bug, so rather this is cleanup and improvement in one.
Usually we pass full console=ttySAC2,115200n8 from UBoot to command
line. The usage of serial options allows skipping that.

I can split the cleanup part from improvement. To me it looked a little
bit too much but I don't mind.

It still can be overridden by command line if needed.
