In the context of PM domains that can be dynamically powered on/off, I'm
not so sure it's perfectly acceptable anymore.

Why doesn't the bus do a _get_sync() instead of a _get_noresume()
followed by a _set_active().  

By using the _get_noresume() you're bypassing the paths that would bring
up your PM domain.
