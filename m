We are not talking here about the normal WFI idle mode. This one works 
correctly and gives huge power savings.

AFTR (which stands for ARM off, TOP running, TOP being a power domain) is a 
mode that is supposed to be deeper than WFI, with all ARM cores powered off, 
but some of the blocks around them keep their state, so the whole system 
can be quickly woke up.

Based on our measurements on Exynos 4210 and 4x12, powering off ARM cores 
don't give any significant amount of power savings (few milliamperes per 
core), with most of the savings already achieved by WFI idle. Since AFTR is 
basically just powering off all ARM cores, including CPU0, I doubt it is 
going to give much higher savings than that.

I don't think we want to put unjustified effort into this. If we are to fix 
it, we should first make sure that it is something that is worth this effort.

The commit that introduced this feature didn't have any rationale to begin 
with, not even saying about any evidence of actual power saving such as 
measurements.

Just for reference, here's commit message of that commit:

	ARM: EXYNOS: Add support AFTR mode on EXYNOS4210

	This patch adds support AFTR(ARM OFF TOP RUNNING) mode in
	cpuidle driver. L2 cache keeps their data in this mode.
	This patch ports the code to the latest interfaces to
	save/restore CPU state inclusive of CPU PM notifiers, l2
	resume and cpu_suspend/resume.

Nothing saying _why_ this is added, just _what_ is added.

I agree, it has not been upstreamed properly, becausE:
 1) it doesn't work,
 2) there was no rationale behind it or at least none was provided in patch 
descriptions.

This mode doesn't have anything to do with power management HW other than 
power management unit inside of the SoC, which is not board specific.

I don't see a point to have code that works, but doesn't do anything useful 
(other than some example/skeleton drivers which aren't supposed to be used 
in other way than as aid for developers). This is why I'd like to see some 
evidence that this feature is good to have, before we start putting effort 
into fixing it on other boards (because this is possibly firmware/bootloader 
specific issue).

I agree. This is not what I meant. What I wanted to say is that no 
rationale has ever been provided for this feature and so we don't know if 
it is worth putting effort into it.

Our internal measurements of similar features tell us that it is unlikely, 
but this is not a result that can be relied on, so I asked for measurements 
on boards for which it works.

Again, this feature is only related to SoC internals and lowest level 
firmware (first stage bootloader, which resumes the CPU), so power saving is 
not board specific here, but SoC-specific.
