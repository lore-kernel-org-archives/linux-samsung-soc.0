And just to clarify, I don't necessarily think "select" is the right
method, as creating an option that defaults to Y if the right
architecture/platform support is present is fine too.

I just don't want users to have to search deeply through menuconfig to
find a clocksource driver checkbox when they have already selected a
platform and provided enough information for us to know which
clocksource driver is needed.  So my argument its really all about
avoiding user-prompts in kconfig for clocksources.  It is conceptually
easier to do this w/ select, but you can also do it via default y and
proper dependencies.
