The S3C24XX starting from S3C2443 (including S3C2416 and S3C2450) also =
use the
s3c64xx-spi driver.

My argument has of course the problem of me seemingly being the only us=
er of
it currently and it being stuff not in mainline yet [0] :-) .

But on the other hand, it's no use anyway staying attached to old cruft=
, so
it also wouldn't be a problem to go your way. I'll just try to come up =
with
a dmaengine driver for s3c24xx after common-clk and pinctrl ;-) .

In ASoC there is also a clear distinction between the different SoC
generations. SND_SAMSUNG_I2S /_PCM /_AC97 ... is only used by newer SoC=
s
while SND_S3C24XX_I2S and SND_S3C_I2SV2_SOC is used by the legacy SoCs.

Of course "my subarch" is bitten again, as it's using the new sound
interface, but the same as above applies.
