Okay.

Ok, sounds reasonable. I want to convert also older platforms S3C (drive
strengths and pull up/down differ) and arm64 SoC: Exynos7. For the
latter the problem is there is no common place for sharing DTS, except
the headers. However this does not really belong to headers. I guess
some level of duplication might be still exist.

We could extend driver by adding new bindings accepting generic numbers
(and still backward compatible) but this looks like an overkill.
