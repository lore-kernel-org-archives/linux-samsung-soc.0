The MPIDR register contains 2 bits for cpu id. Hence maximum number of
cpus can be 4 only (A15/A9/A7).

Exynos4210 and Exynos4x12, cluster ids are not passed from DT as it
breaks the gic_init_bases. Hence the Physical CpuID for Exynos4210
will be 0,1 and Exynos4x12 will be 0,1,2,3.

So it will not break.

As of now the smp-boot (cores > 2) is broken. This is required to fix it.
