Yes, agreed, that what I'm trying to do here ;-)

I realize that building things as modules is a hassle, it is so for
some things more than for others, so I keep asking the question
to everyone to find out what a good balance is to make as much as
possible modules without hurting too much.

Once we have a firm policy in place, we should probably change all
the existing symbols.
