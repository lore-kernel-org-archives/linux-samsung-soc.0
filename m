I agree when the hardware has to handle parallel dependencies ordered in 
waterfall style. In such cases there is usually no point relying on 
software to implement what is nevertheless simple determinism with 
no possible alternative usage.

But the *most* important thing is what you put in parents, so let me 
emphasize on what you just said:

	When triggered _explicitly_ by the OS or external events

The M-class processor should be treated the same way as firmware.  It 
ought to be flexible (certainly more than hardwired hardware), but it 
shares all the same downsides as firmware and the same concerns apply.

I'll claim that this is a bad tradeoff.  And the reason why some 
hardware architects might think it is a good one is because so far we 
really sucked at software based power management in Linux (and possibly 
other OSes as well).  Hence the (fairly recent) realization that power 
management has to be integrated and under control of the scheduler 
rather than existing as some ad hoc subsystem.

The reaction from the hardware people often is "the software is crap and 
makes our hardware look bad, we know better, so let's make it easier on 
those poor software dudes by handling power management in hardware 
instead".  But ultimately the hardware just can't predict things like 
software can.  It might do a better job than the current software state 
of affairs, but most likely not be as efficient as a proper software 
architecture.  The hardware may only be reactive, whereas the software 
can be proactive (when properly done that is).

I sense from your paragraph above that ARM might be going the same 
direction as X86 and that would be very sad.  Maybe the best compromise 
would be for all knobs to be made available to software if software 
wants to turn off the hardware auto-pilot and take control.  This way 
the hardware guys would cover their arses while still allowing for the 
possibility that software might be able to out perform the hardware 
solution.

I agree with you on the hardware cost (and the same argument applies to 
power management by the way).  But once the hardware is there, the 
software cost has to be optimized the same way.

>From a cost perspective, firmware is always a magnitude more costly to 
develop and to fix and maintain afterwards than kernel code.  So, 
without requiring full physical separation increasing the hardware cost, 
I think the software architecture would benefit from a rethought, 
possibly with the help of small and cheap hardware enhancements.  I 
really think not enough attention has been dedicated to that aspect.
