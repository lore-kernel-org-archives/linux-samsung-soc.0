Hi,

Hmm..the difference?

I remember, already said to you...
Anyway actually, there was a stuff in here about that.
Please refer to following...it may answer on your question.

--- From Ben Dooks

I wonder whether just making this depend on either S3C_DEV_RTC, or simply
PLAT_SAMSUNG would just be a better choice.

The S3C_DEV_RTC would mean that the drivers the core of the kernel
would be built, but means that we can't speculatively build drivers
if the kernel hasn't any machines using them.

Making it depend on PLAT_SAMSUNG would mean it is available to all,
but would be selectable even if there isn't a machine supporting it
being built.

The current situation would mean that we have to update driver Kconfig
entries each time a new SoC turns up...

We could also have a HAVE_RTC_DRV_S3C so that all SoCs supporting this
coudl select it independant of whether there is machine support.

---

It doesn't mean that we should use HAVE_XXX in this case...
But this way is better _now_ and they used same method in several drivers.
And if driver IP changes, we can use with HAVE_XXXV2...

I hope you stop talking same issue without alternative...
