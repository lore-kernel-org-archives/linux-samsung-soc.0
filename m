If you are planning to re-submit, then you may please consider
revising the commit message as follows:

s/Introdeced/Introduced
Please provide patch title after the commit Id in braces ("<patch title>").
s/ingored/ignored

You may also elaborate on why IS_ERR_VALUE(!mmc_gpio_get_cd(mmc)) does not work.
