I don't have schematics for Arndale Octa, but the above is really
fishy.  "vmmc" shouldn't be 1.8V.  That's the general power signal to
MMC and should be 2.7V - 3.6V.  "vqmmc" could be 1.8V in certain
situations, but my understanding is that for maximum compatibility it
should at least start out identical to "vmmc" (and later go down to
1.7V - 1.95V).

My first thought would be to just remove the "vmmc-supply" from your
DTS.  I think we could land that and pick it back easily.  That will
get you something working and won't introduce any regressions because:
1. MMC core will give you a dummy regulator
2. The code will default to assuming that vmmc is 3.3V, which is what
it used to do anyway.
3. The only referenced regulator is always on anyway.

Separately you could specify a proper vmmc and maybe even a vqmmc.

On SMDK5420 I see this for the SD card (mmc2):
* vmmc should be "VDD_SD_2V8".  From LDO19.
* vqmmc should be "VDDQ_MMC2_AP".  From LDO13.

OK, I dug up the Arndale schematics.  For mmc2:
* vmmc should be PVDD_TFLASH_2V8.  That's LDO19.
* vqmmc (hooked up to VDDQ_MMC2): PVDD_APIO_MMCOFF_2V8.  LDO13 just like SMDK.

...sadly it looks like Anrdale has a schematics problem that prevents
you from doing UHS.  I see that the data lines are pulled up to
PVDD_TFLASH_2V8 (vmmc), not pulled up to PVDD_APIO_MMCOFF_2V8 (vqmmc).
I think that means that if you ever lower vqmmc to 1.8V (as needed for
UHS) then you'll still be pulling up to 2.8V.  That's not good.  You
should probably make sure that both LDO13 and LDO19 are listed as
being exactly 2.8V.


Anyway, the above has (obviously) not been tested and is just based on
a casual browsing of schematics.  Please let me know how it goes.
