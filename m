Hello,

Based on the preinstalled 3.8 based ChromeOS kernel and previous 3.15=20
based attempts by Stephan and me that broke for 3.16, I've prepared a=20
device tree for the HP Chromebook 11 aka Google Spring.

v5 cleans up a regulator and the USB3503 hub and touches more=20
exynos5250 files.

Not yet enabled are trackpad, Wifi and sound.

My rebasing branch for testing is here:
https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commits/spring-next

Regards,
Andreas

v1 -> v2:
* Dropped 3 documentation patches from series:
  2 picked up,
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4397271/
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4397291/
  1 already sent separately as v2, pending.
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/4424881/
* Minimized and beautified Spring device tree and to some degree Snow a=
s well.
  See individual patches.

v2 -> v3:
* Rebased: Two -cros-common cleanup patches were already applied
* Lots of small cleanups for both Snow and Spring
* Enabled I2S in Spring for symmetry
* Added lid-switch and gpio-keys pinctrls to Spring

v3 -> v4:
* Fixed pin-function 1 -> 0 for dp-hpd pinctrl, style cleanup

v4 -> v5:
* Dropped regulator and fixed USB3503 for Spring
* More cleanups, including SMDK5250 and Arndale
