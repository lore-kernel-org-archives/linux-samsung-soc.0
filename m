Also, at least from the simple blocks I've seen so far (usb-hub chips, usb-
sata bridges), a power-supply feels more like it should be a regular phy-
supply of the usbphy connected the the host-controller.

It's similar for mmc-controllers where vmmc-supply on the controller handles 
the power-supply of the connected card and thus the current mmc power-
sequences do not handle regulators.

Reset-gpios and clock inputs are clearly properties of the actual device, but 
the supply control should probably lay with the host controller, especially as 
it is the one deciding when to power on/off things.
