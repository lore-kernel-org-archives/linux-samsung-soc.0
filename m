Ok guys very sorry about the massive delay in looking at this
again, I have been a bit swamped lately. I think I see what is
going on here.

The fix from Arnd there definitely helped, but still doesn't
quite work and those defines you are talking about there are
actually for the GPIOs so they are a bit of a red herring. There
are two PMICs as you mention one of which is given a fixed IRQ
base and the other which allocates it own. The problem appears to
be that the one which allocates its own IRQ base takes the space
that is specified as the fixed base for the other PMIC. Which
then fails to allocate its IRQs.

So adding a bit of an offset into the PMIC with the fixed IRQ
base fixes the problem. Although I am not sure if it would be
better to move both PMICs onto a fixed IRQ base so there is no
chance of the clashing. Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Charles

Applying this diff, on top of Arnd's fixup, gets everything
working for me:
