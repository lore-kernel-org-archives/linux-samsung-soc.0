If I understand GPD code right :)
There is "small" problem :( Now if PM domain is OFF before suspend
- it's prohibited to turn it on during suspending/resuming.
   commit 596ba34bcd2978ee9823cc1d84df230576f8ffb9
   PM / Domains: System-wide transitions support for generic domains (v=
5)

But, it is possible to have devices which supports few power states, li=
ke:
on, sleep/low power, off (for example OMAP devices and also I saw this
for some I2C devices - can recollect only that it was some sensor and t=
ouchscreen).=20
In normal operational mode Runtime PM switches device between on and sl=
eep/low power states,
but during suspend device need to be woken up and reconfigured to off s=
tate.

Also I found, that It looks like due to continuous refactoring the call=
 of
pm_generic_suspend_noirq(dev) was finally dropped from pm_genpd_suspend=
_noirq(),
so .suspend_noirq() callback will never be called for devices from GPD.

Seems, that is the problem which this patch tries to fix and looks like=
 there are
 will be more such kind of report as GPD is become used widely.
