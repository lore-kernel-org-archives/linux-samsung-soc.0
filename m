My "knee jerk" concern is that we're going to take a runtime PM
lock underneath the prepare lock. That seems like a situation
where we could hit a lock inversion if the runtime PM callbacks
themselves acquire the prepare lock by calling clk APIs? But this
concern is false right? We release the runtime PM lock before
calling the PM callback, so we shouldn't hit any deadlock and
lockdep won't complain?
