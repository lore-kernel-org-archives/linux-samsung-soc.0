Are you saying only CPU0 can program the PMU to enter the AFTR mode ?
And only CPU0 can be woken up ?

Is it possible to have CPU0 to enter the AFTR idle state (without
switching to this mode), save its context and go to WFI. And then when
CPU1 goes to this state also, it saves its context and set the PMU to
enter the AFTR mode ?
