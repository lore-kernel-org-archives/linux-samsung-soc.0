My Exynos5420 UM is Revision 1.00 dated February 2014 and GC_STATUS0 bits
maps LPI_MASK0 with the exception of bit 16 (NR3D) that is not mentioned
in GC_STATUS0, there is a hole between 15 (DIS) and 17 (FIMC_SCALERP).

GC_STATUS1 maps exactly with LPI_MASK1 and GC_STATUS2 and LPI_MASK2 have
the same bits from 0 to 5 and then differ from there.

Sorry, it was a typo error and I actually meant CG_STATUS0 21 and 22 but
these correspond in the documentation I've to 21 (SSS) and 22 (SSS_SLIM).

As I mentioned before, DIS correspond to CG_STATUS0 15 and NR3D doesn't
have a corresponding bit in CG_STATUS0. But I don't know if that is an
error in the doc I've since is suspicious that is the only difference
between LPI_MASK0 and CG_STATUS0.

Yes, I also looked in the ChromiumOS v3.8 kernel but didn't find anything.

Sounds good to me.
