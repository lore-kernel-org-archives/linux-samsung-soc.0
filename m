I was expecting you to merge these patches, but they aren't in the
arm-soc tree and haven't been sent to Linus, and we're in the last few
days of the merge window.

As a result I'm dropping this tree -- and all of the patches that I
have on top of it -- from mmc-next so that I can get a pull request
out.  This means that I'm dropping:

mmc: sdhci-s3c: Add device tree support
mmc: sdhci-s3c: Keep a copy of platform data and use it
mmc: sdhci-s3c: derive transfer width host capability from max_width in 
ARM: SAMSUNG: remove all uses of clk_type member in sdhci platform data
ARM: EXYNOS: use 'exynos4-sdhci' as device name for sdhci controllers
mmc: sdhci-s3c: Remove usage of clk_type member in platform data

.. which I was expecting you to merge, and also:

mmc: sdhci-s3c: fix broken compilation for non-Exynos SoCs
mmc: sdhci-s3c: Enable runtime power management
mmc: sdhci-s3c: Use CONFIG_PM_SLEEP to ifdef system suspend
mmc: sdhci-s3c: use devm_ functions

.. which were merged on top of the above patches.

We'll have to try again with 3.5 for the new features, and post-rc1 for
the fixes.  Please let me know what happened with this merge.  Thanks,

- Chris.
