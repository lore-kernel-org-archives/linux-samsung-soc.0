Ah, I see. I wasn't aware that display subsystem has bindings even for 
the connectors.
Other types of connectors already used together with extcon in device 
tree (like usb
and chargers) don't have dedicated bindings.

Do we need to add hdmi-connectors to all existing boards that have HDMI 
module?
