No it didn't.

I am not very sure that this is an ABI break, as other platforms (e.g
hisilicon,hip01-smp) also adopted this as some later stage and they also
removed smp hook support from their machine files when they adopted to
this enable-method in DTS files.

If we want to keep older DTBs keep working with new Kernel image, then I
need to drop patch from mach-exynos and keep smp_ops hook in machine
descriptor as it is to keep supporting older DTBs. I can see some
platforms have adopted this way as well.

Surely I will add new bindings details in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/cpus.txt file. I am not sure why
checkpatch did not complain about this?

Since I am not sure if this will considered as ABI break or not, I just
looked how this was handled in other platforms, I can see some platforms
have clubbed DTS change along with mach files, and some have done in
separate patch as well. So I will look for suggestion from you for this
how we can go for exynos platform?
