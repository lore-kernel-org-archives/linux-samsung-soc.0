I could not understand your point of reordering, will you please explain 
this.

There has been discussion about the proper location for this driver, 
initial attempt was done in "drivers/mfd" folder but then we realized 
that this driver is not exactly fitting in MFD category.
There was suggestion from Catalin Marinas [1], [2] to move it to 
"drivers/power" or a more suitable place other than mfd. As I received 
comments from Bartlomiej [3] and other members also (sorry I could not 
produce all links as it was quite more than a year back), I feel driver 
is very much SoC specific and hence decided to move it here.

Ok will keep them in CC in next revision.
