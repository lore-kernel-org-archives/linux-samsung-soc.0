For Exynos chipsets coupled C-states are not strictly required for
having cpuidle support but make it more useful.  On Exynos chipsets
secondary CPUs must be disabled to allow system to go into deeper
idle modes and this is assured by using coupled C-states.  Original
Android drivers don't use coupled C-states and depend on the rest
of the system to offline secondary CPUs when not needed.

I would of course prefer not to have handle this in software and
be automatically handled by hardware/firmware but that doesn't mean
that we should be declining mainline support for "ugly" hardware
(this has never been "the Linux way" of doing things).

Coming back to the platforms in question (ARM32 big.LITTLE based
Odroid XU3 boards etc.) they have been shipped long time ago and
the best we can do nowadays is to support them as well as possible.

If somebody wants to implement a separate Exynos542x/Exynos5800
big.LITTLE cpuidle driver for them I see no problem with it and I'm
willing to help in maintaining it.

I hope that on ARM64 PSCI will be used.  However I have no access to
chipset designers / original firmware authors so I can't tell for
sure.
