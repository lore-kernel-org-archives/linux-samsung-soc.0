Hmm. Ok. Thanks for the info.

I'm not so sure switching from a global lock to a more granular
lock is _always_ a great idea. Sometimes simpler code is better,
even if it doesn't scale to a million clk nodes. The largest
systems I've seen only have clocks in the hundreds, and a
majority of those aren't rate changing in parallel, so it's not
like we're suffering from VFS type scalability problems here with
tens of thousands of inodes.

That isn't to say I don't agree there's a scalability problem
here, but I'd like to actually see numbers to prove that there's
some sort of scalability problem before making drastic changes.

So far I haven't gotten around to resurrecting the wwmutex stuff.
If you have interest in doing it that's great. Having a locking
scheme with rules of DO/DON'T sounds brittle to me, unless it can
be automated to find problems. I know that I'm not going to spend
time policing that.

I suppose this is a different topic. Regardless of the recursive
call or not, we can easily see that a clk consumer is also a clk
provider and just knowing that is useful. Once we know that, we
can look to see if they're calling clk consumer APIs from their
provider callbacks which is not desired because it makes it
impossible to get rid of the recursive lock design. If the lock
is per-clock, then recursion doesn't happen when the provider is
also a consumer. If it does, that's bad and lockdep should tell
us.
