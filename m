Guys, do not get me wrong here. There are fixes that can be deemed
acceptable in an OS, there are fixes that can't. I just can't help thinking
that Nicolas' patch is a nasty hack (and I am far, really really far from
blaming him for that, because that's the only patch that can fix that
issue in the kernel), and he perfectly knows that.

1) Blame taken, nothing to say. That's why I mentioned that CCI enablement
   must be part of a boot protocol document to prevent this from happening
   again.

2) Apart from the boot cluster, but that's related to (1).

I agree with what you are saying, but if for any reason someone will
copy that code to paper over yet another firmware quirk and think that's
the right thing to do, that would be grave IMHO.

So:

1) CCI requirements added to boot document
2) If Nico's patch get in we must stick a massive disclaimer summing up
   this thread in there
3) Next time the answer will be: NAK.

Do we agree ? I still have very strong feelings against (2) and I would
be very glad to avoid merging that patch.

I have zero leverage, but still the right to say what I think.
The patch fixing CCI enablement for the boot CPU is a nasty hack
and that's certainly not Nicolas' fault.

I understand your point, and I do not want to stop people from using
this platform with upstream code, actually I am the first who is happy
to see power management code getting in the mainline, but not at all costs,
because this has consequences for US.

ARM are pushing for open trusted firmware, ARM TRMs are available to
partners with those sequences described, and I have always been willing
to support developers.

We should do more, but that does not justify these bugs, really.

Olof, it is not puritanism, it is all about upstreaming code. If we
keep accepting these hacks and we end up with mach code full of them
we have a problem, do you agree ?

You, Russell and Nico know what to do, I wanted to get my opinion
across and I think you got my point.

I do not buy this I am sorry. Fair enough, CCI is a new concept, but
SMP power management has been implemented in older platforms with
the same requirements, nothing new and still people are getting this
wrong.

See above. And let's hope MCPM is useful at all on this platform, which
means CPUidle can be enabled and working.

PSCI is not a random framework, it is a standard and it runs in real
world platforms and would hide all these HW quirks where they belong.

It won't be perfect, but hey, neither is this code.

See above, blame taken but FW/HW engineers should know that a multicluster
coherent system should have coherent caches to be properly booted.
