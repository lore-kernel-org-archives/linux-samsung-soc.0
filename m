Ok.
I think chromeos-3.8 kernel must work well with v7 also.
But there're a lot of changes in device tree of exynos SoC
and exynos-iommu driver followed by the changes in device tree
since 3.8 kernel.
I worry that back-porting of v7 is not trivial.

I agree with you.
Actually, exynos-iommu driver in Android devices based on 3.4 kernel
sets System MMUs as the parent of their Master devices in the different
initcalls.
(You can find it in the kernel of Galaxy S4 which contains Exynos SoC.)
There are several reasons.
Some devices are not involved in generic IO powerdomain and
genpd_pm_ops is not called for the devices.
Some devices are not proper to handle System MMU with genpd_pm_ops.

I wished that every device which has System MMU uses generic IO powerdomain
for its power management.

If I can be convince myself of that setting System MMU as the parent of
its master device is not a problem, I will not hesitate to do so.

I understand what you are talking about.
Many people including me are finding a way to abstract different types
of H/W. I think IOMMU API is one of the result and DMA mapping framework
for ARM architecture is already finished with IOMMU API.

One of the inefficiency in the current implementation of DMA mapping for
ARM architecture is TLB invalidation which you addressed above.
TLB invalidation interface in IOMMU API was introduced earlier but it was
discarded. We can propose that if any others also agree.

Actually, I defined several custom TLB maintenance interfaces
for the kernel of our product to manage TLB efficiently.
