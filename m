Do you want to say that we have enough tests and we don't need more ?

I always thought that we shall have as much regression tests as
possible.

Hmm... If "regression" and "test" don't catch the attention of a
diligent maintainer, then I cannot do much more to encourage him to
read the whole e-mail :-)

I can imagine that maintainers are very busy, therefore I've prepared
README file with detailed description of the script operation.

Rafael, I'm open for suggestions.

First of all the cpufreq attributes are part of the subsystem API.
There are systems which actually depend on them, so we would be better
off to test if they work as intended.

Secondly, the test takes those values and then with use of other
attribute enforce the value, which is then read via cat'ing
cpufreq_cur_freq. If any of the attributes is wrong then we will spot
the error immediately.

Errors with cpufreq and CCF cooperation - especially when some parts of
cpufreq code uses direct write to MUX, DIV or PLL SoC registers.

Also, one can check if permutations of changing all available
frequencies are working properly.

This script allowed me to find at least two bugs at Exynos cpufreq
subsystem in the past. And those fixes are already applied to mainline.

There is a clean shell script code to go through it, the README file
with detailed description of the script purpose and operation.

What else shall I write?
