hmm..

how about passing the device names of PHY in platform data of the controller?
It should be deterministic as the PHY framework assigns its own id and we
*don't* want to add any requirement that the ID must be assigned manually
without using PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO. We can get rid of *phy_init_data* in the v10
patch series.

Thanks
