Here we go again with sucky work practices.

This sucky behaviour has been around for a long time, I've long since
given up complaining about it as it's exactly like talking to a bloody
brick wall.  People just continue mixing development and fixes together.

They then wonder why their fixes don't make it into mainline in a timely
fashion.

Maybe delaying the whole lot will make people change their behaviour:
it's a behaviour that needs to change at the submitters end.  There's
nothing which Olof or Arnd can reasonably do to expedite the fixes.

So, please direct your complaints to the submitter for not having a
work practice which ensures that fixes receive a higher submission
priority.

Note: Linus _has_ taken a copy of linux-next (read the 3.2 release email),
and _is_ checking whether development stuff was in linux-next prior to
the merge window opening.  It would be very unwise to send new development
which wasn't already there.
