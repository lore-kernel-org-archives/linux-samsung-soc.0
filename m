Agreed. The context is actually much wider than the CPU cooling. In
fact, cooling co-processors is actually where things gets a bit
complicated. The idea behind this type of handshaking is to allow the
affected subsystem to change their actual setup when max performance
is not allowed anymore.

Yeah. Ideally, the framework needs to be aware of cooling device state
change. Today, as we have pretty much a broadcast/unidirectional type
of messaging, the framework/policy always assumes the cooling devices
will be in sync with what it is dictated by the policy.

Agreed. I second you that this problem is a much wider issue and needs
improvement in the FW itself and how the cooling devices are designed.
