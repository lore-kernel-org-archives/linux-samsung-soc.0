Yes/no/maybe :). Imho this is something to clarify in the pwm API
documentation. As currently all it says is:=20
  "pwm_disable - stop a PWM output toggling",=20

Which is what the exynos driver does.=20

Thierry, could you clearify what the intention is here? I'm happy to
prepare a pwm driver patch if needed to solve this?
