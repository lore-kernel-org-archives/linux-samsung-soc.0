These bindings came up in a discussion IRC today. I think it's rather bad that
we can't agree on a common way to name the properties for mmc. We have
bindings being proposed or already included from Anton, Stephen, Shawn,
Rajendra, Viresh, Lee and Thomas. Almost all of them define GPIO pins
for card detect and write protect, as well properties to define the bus
width and high-speed modes, but we seem to have almost as many different
definitions of these as we have drivers.

Can we please come up with a common binding for these?
