I agree that the other case needs to be handled as well. Basically the
whole conditional block dependent on exynos4x12_pms_change() can be safely
dropped, because this condition is already handled in PLL driver.

Lukasz is already working on further rework of this driver to clean it up
from legacy code, but this will have to wait for 3.13, as 3.12 is already
in rc stage and only fixes can be accepted for it.

Unfortunately this is not how this flag works. It only makes
clk_get_rate() call ->recalc_rate() operation of the clock instead of
instantly returning cached rate - it doesn't seem to work recursively.

Best regards,
Tomasz
