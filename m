Okay, that indeed looks similar... in case of lack of external supplies
the usb3503 pins should be tied to the internal regulators.

However it seems I was wrong at the beginning. We've been looking here
at the schematics and the datasheet. The design is unfortunately a
little bit confusing but finally I think we got the impression how does
it work.

This VDD regulator supply actually is not a usb3503 USB HUB regulator
supply... but a supply to the LAN attached to this HUB. Regulator off/on
is needed for LAN to show up. The hub will show up with typical reset
(which is also missing before my patchset btw).

The LAN, as a USB device, is auto-probed so it cannot take the regulator
and play with it. The simplest idea I have is to add it as "external
supply"  to the parent: usb3503.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
