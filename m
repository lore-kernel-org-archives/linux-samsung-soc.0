It is a platform (SoC) issue in terms of enabling PM_RUNTIME, which is 
pure software, as you're pointing out. I think we agree here that the 
only issue is that some (ill) platforms refuse to enable PM_RUNTIME.

And clock gating belongs to runtime PM, which this I2C controller driver
chooses to implement without runtime PM awareness.

It's not pretty, I agree. However it is supposed to be more a temporary
solution, rather than anything final. And it probably is better at 
avoiding any races and mismatch between real device state and the PM core
knowledge of it. I'm not going to persuade my version too much, it's far
from prefect, similarly as the original patch in this thread. The best 
solution would be to force platform to enable PM_RUNTIME if they want to
use a driver which does runtime PM. But this has to wait, yet, probably
infinitely.. :)
