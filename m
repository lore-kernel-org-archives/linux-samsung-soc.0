Which is my concern actually. If the struct does not describe reg/irq
resources, or even worse if it describes them partially, do we want to
let the user shoot himself on the foot?

Granted this might happen with device tree too, but I find it much
more likely with generic platform devices.

Maybe we should adopt a whitelist instead?
