ok, Thank you for spotting this.

Yes, you are right, I will delete this 'include delay.h'

I also think it can be ignored, it uses 104 bytes on stack in case of SHA256 ,
sizeof struct sha256_state for SW generic implementation, found in 
include/crypto/sha.h

Here I made bad formatting, it should read:

* -EBUSY if queue is full and request should be resubmitted later,
* other	negative values on error.

I do not want to specify explicitly all error negative codes here, as it also uses
s5p_hash_enqueue and these return codes are referenced from other places. I intended
to listing success values, 0, -EINPROGRESS, then explaining -EBUSY, then adding all
other negative as error. The other values can be -EINVAL, -ENOMEM or maybe other, when
this module gets extended to HMAC implementation.

I agree and I prefer to keep it in current shape, this patch is already big.

You are right, I will drop first condition. BTW what compiler options are you using ?
This one was not reported by my compilation process.
