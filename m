This patch series adds device tree support for Synopsis Designware Mobile
Storage Host Controller.

The first patch converts the copy of controller device instance into a
reference. This is need to allow device resource management api to correctly
manage the resources allocated by the driver. The second patch fixes the
incorrect abort of the probe in case a slot initialization fails. This is
fixed by allowing as many slots to be initialized successfully and failing
only if there are no slots that were initialized.

The third patch adds clock lookup in the driver and this is optional. Platforms
that do not need any clock gating and control for the dw_mmc controllers will
not be affected with this change. The fourth patch adds a quirk to notify the
controller about the absence of the write protect line.

The fifth patch adds device tree based discovery support for the dw_mmc driver.
The sixth patch add Samsung Exynos5250 specific extentions to the driver.

This patchset is based on Samsung kernel tree's for-next branch with the
mmc tree's mmc-next branch merged.
