Right, this makes sense. I assumed status was latched output and might
be lost. But that's wrong assumption I believe.

Interesting even GIC loses power ? I would be interested in knowing more
details as who will wake up the system then. Is the wakeup source
offloaded to some external power controller ?

Yes, I did search and find nothing, so definitely not U-Boot if I am
looking at the right source.

Agreed, not because I believe ROM code are not crazy but because of the
theory you have provided above :)
