I did post this patch and reviewed by maintainer.
The request was reflected to following patch.
Also, I did explain the constraints of the regulator of WM8994 codec
and resend following patch. This patch include Goni and Aquila board code
related to audio.
	[PATCH] ARM: S5PV210: Add audio support to Goni and Aquila board

This is my mistake, "RESEND" word is leaved out in the subject.

Thanks,
