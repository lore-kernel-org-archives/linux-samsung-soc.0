It is correct for genpd, it isn't correct for the ACPI PM domain.

I agree that the terminology is (somewhat?) confusing.

>From the code perspective, using a PM domain object is a way to provide PM
callbacks that will be executed for a subset of devices instead of or in
addition to the bus type (or class or device type) callbacks.  Of course,
that applies to proper power domains in particular, but it can also apply
to broader sets of devices.  In the ACPI PM domain case this covers devices
with ACPI power management support (or more precisely, devices with ACPI
companion objects that can provide PM support).  In this context the word
"domain" means as much as "area of control" (which is a proper dictionary
definition of it AFAICS).

genpd is all about proper power domains, like you said.

That's why I'm saying that they are different and clamping them both
together was a mistake.  I overlooked that, my bad.
