OK, this is also an acceptable solution (though it seems to be worse
in terms of simplicity and long term maintainance). Anyway please ignore
my comments to v1, just remember to rename this flag (as already pointed
by out by Amit). TMU_SUPPORT_SHARED_MEMORY documentation in exynos_tmu.h
also requires an update.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/exynos-thermal.txt update got
lost and it is quite important now as second address servers multiple
purposes. Please fix it.
