changes in v9:
	Updated the changes suggested by Chris for kernel coding comaptibility 
changes in v8:
	Updated the changes suggested by Philip for bus mode test. 
changes in v7:
	Updated with review comments for minor changes in host conditional
	handling. added the handling for 4 bit bus width. 
Changes in v6:
	split the patch into 2 and classified them as a patch for device
	and host. Modified to include the review comments.
Changes in v5:
	Reduced the case statements for better code readability. Removed
	unused macro definitions. Modified the tuning function prototype
	and definition to support tuning for both SD and eMMC cards.
Changes in v4:
	Rebased onto chris-mmc/mmc-next branch. This patch is successfully
	applied on commit with id de022ed3fdc14808299b2fa66dbb1ed5ab921912.
Changes in v3:
	In the previous commits of chris-mmc/mmc-next branch, the patch with
	commit id (c0f22a2c92e357e7cb3988b0b13034d70b7461f9) defines caps2 for
	more capabilities. This patch version deletes the member ext_caps
	(created in my earlier patch) from struct mmc_host and reuses already
	accepted caps2 member.
Changes in v2:
	Rebased to latest chris-mmc/mmc-next branch. Resolved indentation
	problems identified in review. This patch has to be applied before
	the patch released for modifying the printk messages.
Changes in v1:
	Case statements in switch that produce same result have been combined
	to reduce repeated assignments. patch recreated after rebase to chris
	Balls mmc-next branch.
