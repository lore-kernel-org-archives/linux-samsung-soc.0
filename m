Many of your comments were apt so I agreed to most of them :)

By every time I mean like using the opp table and getting voltage from
there and then doing set_voltage. For me if I use opp table it is just
once during initializations so i didn't use it.

Yes agreed this is repetition.

Yes but during init also if interrupts starts arriving before complete
initialization so to protect that case it is there. I suppose there
are other ways. Will check them
