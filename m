I think it is important we finally merge _a_ driver, giving users a useful
touchscreen after many, many years of delay.  Whoever has issues with that
driver should simply address those issues and propose incremental patches to
it.

This is speaking with both my former Openmoko "hat" as well as considering
what is most important for Samsung System LSI.
