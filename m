This patch series is part of patch series [1], which adds support of SCU
device node for Cortex-A9 based Exynos4 SoC. First two patches of the same
has been accepted and hence not included them in v3.

This patch series does some cleanup for Exynos4 SoC based boards.
We are currently statically mapping SCU SFRs in mach-exynos/exynos.c
which can be avoided if map this from device node of SCU

This patch series is prepared on Krzysztof's for-next
(SHA_ID: b33c7bb9d59c3f4100d4)

I have tested these patches on Exynos4210 based on Origen board for SMP boot.
Patchset v1 was tested by Marek Szyprowski on Exynos4412-based Odroid U3
for SMP boot and S2R.

To confirm concern raised by Alim, I intentionally removed SCU device node
from exynos4.dtsi and tested on Origen board, I can see code handles this
case gracefully without any crash and system boot was fine. Of-course in such
case only single core will be able to boot.

Following boot message observed on Origen in case of missing SCU node

Changes since v2:
 - Removed unnecessary header file inclusion from pm.c.
 - Move out call_firmware_op call from CORTEX-A9 check.
 - Update commit log for 1/2 patch describing dependency on DTS and affect of
   the patch on out-of-tree DTS

Changes since v1:
 - Address review comments from Krzysztof
 - Moved scu_enable from pm.c and suspend.c to single place in platsmp.c
 - Added error handling during scu_enable in platsmp.c
 - Added Reviewed-by tag from Alim.
