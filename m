Thanks Nico for the detailed description on the requirements for using
MCPM. This is the kind of issue I was worried in the other thread on
Fijitsu platform. That's the reason I was asking the information about
their secure firmware and what exactly it configures so that we won't
end up with similar situation on there too and definitely not to push
PSCI. I completely agree with you that making a some change in firmware
to give control of CCI to kernel is easy.

Probably if the vendors disagree to apply this small fix to the firmware
we should provide them with *only choice* of PSCI implementation which
is quite complex and easy to get it wrong. That might trigger them to
provide a small fix to use MCPM.

Sudeep
