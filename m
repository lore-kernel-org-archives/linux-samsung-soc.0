Adding the SCU nodes now makes sense. So does using them if they're available.

Given the prevalence of exynos systems with DTS already out there, it
would make sense to give an overlap of making the kernel work without
the SCU in DT for a period of time.

This isn't like the old days of when we were mass-converting things
and breakage was expected. We're well into a steady state here, so
being nicer to downstream users is likely the right thing to do here.
