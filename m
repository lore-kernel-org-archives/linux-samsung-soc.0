You're right aspect of only implementation of device driver.

But,
If we use your commented approach, we can show the information
of only parent device through sysfs. We cannot see the information
of passive device. The some information includes the current
frequency and correlation of parent device. (But, current patchset
don' include the topology information between parent device and
passive device. I'll do it on later patches).

We can see the following bus device through /sys/class/devfreq.

drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 Dec 31 17:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 44 root root 0 Dec 31 17:00 ..

We don't see the following bus device because of following bus device
has the same frequency table with bus_leftbus device.
