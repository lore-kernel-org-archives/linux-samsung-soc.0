Yeah, this seemed to be going in the right direction.

You say that now. But then at some point somebody decides that it might
be useful to have a second instance.

I don't see how that's relevant here.

And that's precisely why there should be a more explicit way of
synchronizing than just acquiring a lock. Otherwise you have no
possibility whatsoever to detect when a board tries to use both the
clocksource and PWM drivers in incompatible ways. The lock may prevent
concurrent accesses to the shared registers, but that won't help you if
the PWM driver suddenly decides to use an output that was originally
meant to be used as clock source.

Okay, I like simple. But I see too much potential for this to break
in the future. There are just too many assumptions for my taste. It
isn't anything that I'm looking forward to have to maintain.
