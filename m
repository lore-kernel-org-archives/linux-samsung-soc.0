Ok, I had not looked at the second patch carefully enough. There are
four interrupt controller nodes but I am still not sure if the
bindings for those nodes are correct. The question here is, did we
design the binding to suit a specific linux implementation of the
interrupt controller. Ideally, the bindings should just be enough to
explain the interconnection between the interrupt controller and the
client devices. And should be OS agnostic as much as possible. The
seven irqtypes in the binding definition seems to suggest that we are
encoding a software defined abstraction into the binding, which does
not seem right.

I believe the three node example that I listed above should be able to
handle this, but yes, it might require additional code to support it.
=46or example, the uart device node has listed three interrupts. The
uart controller drivers can register three separate interrupt handlers
for these interrupts. As far as the interrupt handling for 'main'
controller, I see that this is very similar to the way interrupt
combiner module has been coded for exynos soc's. So the combiner
interrupt controller code in mach-exynos/common.c file can be used a
reference on how this can be handled.

Yes, I understand how difficult it can get while writing a generalized
code for all soc's in s3c24xx family.

Thanks,
