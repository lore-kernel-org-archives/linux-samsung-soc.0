No, it is still broken in linux-next (as I stated above.)

Moreover, earlier in this thread you mentioned you were merging some
MCPM patches that should address this, but did not respond when I
asked which patches you thing should address this issue

Do you have some colleagues with any other 542x hardware?  I had
assumed that linux-next was being better tested on the publicaly
available, and widely available boards like odroid-xu3 and
Chromebook2, but I've come to realize the hard way that that is not
the case.  You mention your board has a different bootloader.  Do you
suspect there's a bootloader issue on these other platforms?  If so,
could you elaborate on possible fixes?  I'm more than willing to test
any proposed fixes, but I'm not familiar enough yet with these SoCs to
figure out the underlying issues alone.

Until you have a working board farm, you could start having a closer
look at the boot logs we're already producing.  Admittedly linux-next
broken in many ways besides this one for exynos currently, but it has
been having these imprecise aborts well before the other recent
issues.

Also, It's very possible that this issue is not even MCPM related at
all, and MCPM is just uncovering a previously hidden bug.  It would be
very helpful if people more familiar with this hardware and SoC would
investigate bug reports like these.
