Was told that that only new libata based drivers would be accepted.

considering CF in true-ide mode..should I still add the check?

Should have been (240, 93, 40, 70, 25)

yes..but for V210/C110 just the ioremapped info->ide_addr with 0 offset is
enough.

V210/C110 requires 0 offset as compared to 6410 and C100 which require
0x1800.

OK..will request mem_region() before ioremap()..and then the release_mem's
should be fine.


Thanks.
