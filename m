I can't send the tree as it is to Linus now, because Arnd has asked us
to hold off on these device tree bindings and work with the unified
bindings he's proposing instead.  (Rebasing to drop that patch will
introduce new conflicts.)

I'm going to send Mark Brown's two patches to Linus now, even though it
will cause a conflict in -next.  The rest (other than the device tree
bindings) are mergable after -rc1, because they're fixes, so we'll
eventually get everything except DT in to 3.4.  I think you should
just drop this patchset from your tree in linux-next entirely now.

Thanks,

- Chris.
