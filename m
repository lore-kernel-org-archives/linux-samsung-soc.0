For eMMC devices supporting SLEEP, the SLEEP cmd must be issued before 
powering down the VCC to the card. Otherwise we are violating the eMMC 
spec. (Some eMMC device accept the above condition anyway, so that might 
be why your devices were able to resumed without any problem).

I understand, but I think we should never have put the card into 
suspend/sleep state if we now that the card support poweroff notify 
feature. The poweroff notify shall be handled similar how sleep is 
handled from within the suspend function, I think.

Yes, and thus violating the eMMC spec for devices supporting SLEEP.

I am not saying that this should not be done, just saying that should 
this been done within this patch. It has nothing to do with poweroff notify.
