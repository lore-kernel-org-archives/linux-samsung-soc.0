I'd be very appreciated if you would be able to clarify one point to me as
I'm not familiar with amba hw?

I've found at least 2 AMBA drivers where secondary clock is used 
to enable/disable device in addition to "apb_pclk":
 - drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c 
 - drivers/spi/spi-pl022.c
So, form the code point of view, the assumption that "unbound AMBA devices are
already powered up" is not always true. And "apb_pclk" is just an interface clock
in such cases. 
>From another side above statement is true for mailbox/pl320-ipc.c which seems like
is simple device.
Am I wrong?

Thanks in advance.
