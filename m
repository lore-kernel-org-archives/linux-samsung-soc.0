Any update on this patch. As already it has been tested on two DT based
platforms.

If you think that we can go ahead and break clps711x till it gets migrated
over DT,
then please ack this patch, or else if you have opinion to keep support for
non-DT
based drivers (clps711x) then I can post another patch keeping platform
driver support
for non-DT based platform. 

I would prefer is to keep platform driver support for non-DT based platform
so that this patch set can go in this merge window, as lot of Exynos PMU
patches
(PMU patches of many Exynos SoCs [2,3,4] ) are critically dependent on this
change. 

As per discussion here [1], clps711x SPI and TTY driver patches still has to
be posted
which may take one more merge window, and eventually will drag this patch
also.
