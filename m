I think this should be part of a refactoring that includes the exynos MCPM
suspend call parameters. In particular, at the moment there is no code in
the back-end to detect if the last man should request core gating or cluster
gating (ie last man _always_ request cluster gating, that might not be what
we want), there is the residency value that can be also be used to imply a
S2R request (eg residency = ~0 ?).

The command sent must be implied by the state that is entered, not by
peeking at registers that should contain magic values, and that's true
not only for exynos but for all ARM platforms out there.

What I mean is: we can pass the requested state as a suspend parameter
and the power_down state machine will send the required command
accordingly.

It can be done using the residency value or by passing the power state "index"
as suspend parameter, the power down MCPM code will do a look-up and send
the respective command.

Thoughts appreciated.
