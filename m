thanks for the detailed explanation. Certainly initcall is not good
for multikernel. Still I have few concerns.
1) Each C state might be SOC specific. Say there are 3 C states
C0(basic wfi), c1(single CPU power down) and C2 (System wide power
down like AFTR). In this case some exynos soc may support few of these
states and cpuidle driver should bind C-state to correct SOC.
2) Even for default C0 ( simple wfi) currently there is no sysfs
information if the cpuidle driver is not registered(Not quite sure).
I will try to post the new driver by dynamically creating the
cpuidle_state table based on SOC capability and removing the initcall.
