Right, we need some way to group the configuration parameters. Either
one big struct, or something like start_config() and end_config(). I
think we could also think what parameters make no sense to be configured
on the fly, and possibly have those separately. Although it may be a bit
difficult to think of all the (weird) use cases.

The parameters used for configuration itself is platform specific, and
that's why it needs to be defined in the DT data. But the API itself is
not platform specific. The parameters are information about how the
panel is connected, just like, say, number of data lines is for DPI.
Which is also something I think should be configured by the panel.

No, it works for everyone. Well, at least I still don't see anything
omap or platform specific in the API. Of course, if the platform/device
doesn't support modifying the pin functions, then the function does nothi=
ng.

The information about how the panel is connected (the wiring) has to be
somewhere in the DT data. We could have the info in the DSI master or in
the DSI slave. Or, in some platforms where the DSS is not involved in
the muxing/config, the info could be totally separate, in the boards
pinmuxing data.

I think all those work ok for normal cases without hotplug. But if you
have hotplug, then you need separate pinmuxing/config data for each panel=
=2E

You could possibly have a list of panels in your DSI master node,
containing the muxing data, but that sounds rather hacky, and also very
hardcoded, i.e. you need to know each panel that is ever going to be
connected.

If, on the other hand, you have the info in the panel node, it "just
works". When a new panel is connected, the relevant panel DT data comes
from somewhere (it's not relevant where), and it tells the DSI master
how it's connected.

Something like this is probably needed for the BeagleBone capes, if you
have happened to follow the discussion. Although it could be argued that
the capes may perhaps be not runtime hotswappable, and thus the
configuration can be done only once during boot after the cape has been
probed. But I'd rather not design the API so that we prevent hot swapping=

Well, if omap is the only SoC/device out there that supports configuring
the pin functions, and everybody is against the API, I'm not going to
press it.

But then again, I think similar configuration support may be needed even
for the normal pinmuxing, even in the case where you can't reconfigure
the DSI pin functions. You still need to mux the pins (perhaps, say,
between DSI and a GPIO), depending on how many lanes the panel uses.

In fact, speaking about all pins in general, I'm not very fond of having
a static pinmuxing in the board DT data, handled by the board setup
code. I think generally the pins should be muxed to safe-mode by the
board setup code, and then configured to their proper function by the
driver when it is initializing.

Yes, the hotplug mechanism is platform/board specific. But that's not
relevant here.

Yes, as I said, I also think we shouldn't aim for hotplug in the v1. But
we also shouldn't prevent it.
