Hi Stephen,

Thanks for your comments.

Good point. I wasn't aware of the relation between unit address and reg 
property. I thought it was just for readability.

It will be added in further patches that add per-bank GPIO addressing.

In this RFC, this property is just used to distinguish pin bank nodes from 
pin group nodes.

Hmm, considering so many different possible changes, maybe a more 
conservative solution would be better, like reducing the amount of 
information held in DT to bank type, e.g.

	samsung,bank-type = "exynos4";

or maybe

	compatible = "samsung,exynos4-pin-bank*;

and then define supported bank types in the driver. SoC-specific data would 
remain in DT, i.e. pctl-offset, pin-bank, pin-count, eint-offset, etc.

Just as with gpio-controller before, in this RFC this is just a mark to 
distinguish banks with interrupts from banks without interrupts.

Further patches will allow to use it properly (and will add #interrupt-
cells property too).

I have seen both variants, with upper-case being more popular across 
Samsung's dts files and so I have chosen to use it. (Personally I prefer 
lower-case, though, if it does matter.)

Right.

Yes, they do.

Exynos4210-pincstrl-banks.dtsi isn't shared, it's specific to Exynos4210. 
Other SoCs are going to have their own whatever-pinctrl-banks.dtsi.

Yes. There is a bunch of CON registers one after another, for each bank, 
which supports interrupts and similarly for MASK and PEND. All those geint-
xxx properties define the location of first register and eint-offset 
defines location of register for particular bank.
