Device tree bindings are defined according to the first SoC in which
given hardware variant appeared and since they are stable, they should
stay as is. I don't think it will have any negative effects on
maintenance costs and it doesn't imply that the SoC is still supported.

(Anyway, with DT you can boot virtually any SoC, without the kernel
being aware of it, as long as it supports all the necessary IP blocks.)
