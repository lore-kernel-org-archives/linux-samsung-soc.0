In case of Exynos SoC both IOMMU and master device are in the same power 
domain.
During iommu_attach() call driver needs to have power domain enabled, 
but power
domain driver is probed from arch_initcall(). I wanted to move power domain
initialization earlier to ensure that it will happen before IOMMU driver 
probe,
that not really a problem. Right now it usually works, because power 
domains are
enabled by bootloader.

However please not that I would really like to have something merged. The
discussion about iommu controllers lasts for about 2 years and we still 
don't
have ANYTHING working in mainline, so lets merge the of_iommu glue and then
check how the remaining issues can be solved.
