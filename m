Thanks for explanation. By the way, who binds '#sound-dai-cells' property?.
This patch adds this property to hdmi device node which will be bound by HDMI driver fo Exynos DRM but I don't see any place to bind '#sound-dai-cells' property in this driver.
So I think some driver like Odroid XU3/4 audio driver(sound/soc/samsung/odroid.c) or ASoC simple audio card driver(sound/soc/generic/simple-card.c) should exist and this property should be placed to such device node.

Thanks,
Inki Dae
