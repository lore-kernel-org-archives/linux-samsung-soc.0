I was trying to provide bindings for the MMC_CAP_XXX defined in
include/linux/mmc/host.h file. I am no expert in mmc subsystem but I
believe that these capabilities are not directly mapped to any
capabilities register in the host controller hardware. All of the
MMC_CAP_XXX defines are flags used by the mmc core to make runtime
decisions. The host controller driver would read its capability
register and report its capabilities to the mmc core layer using these
MMC_CAP_XXX defines.

But not all of the MMC_CAP_XXX defines can be derived from a
capabilities register of a host controller. Some of the MMC_CAP_XXX
capabilities are used as defaults by the host controller driver while
some others which are board dependent are feed to the host controller
driver using the platform data.

While migrating a host controller driver to device tree, and not
relying on the aux data for platform data, there has to be mechanism
to specify the mmc core subsystem capabilities which are board
specific and I though bindings for MMC_CAP_XXX could be an option.

Ok. But that would remain just as sdhci host controller capability and
will not be applicable to other types of host controllers.

Apologies. I will be more verbose next time.

I am not sure on this. Maybe it might have some dependency on the host
controller as well.
