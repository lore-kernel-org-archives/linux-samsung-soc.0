Thanks for the info, I missed that.

Yes, now it makes sense.

As you said, these are not usable in the current form since if someone
wants to use it, has to add a dev node for the I2C device, possibly a
clock-frequency to change the default operating frequency, etc.

So has to either create a new DTS based on exynos5422-odroidxu4.dts or
as you said use OF overlays. IMHO these should be left disabled and be
enabled by users when adding the needed stuff.
