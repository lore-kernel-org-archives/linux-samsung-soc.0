Why a struct for each specific match_type is **needed**? It it is not
needed, then it is senseless per definition :-) 

In the specific case of fwnode, there's already a named struct
for fwnode_handle. The only thing is that it is declared outside
enum v4l2_async_match_type. So, I don't see any reason to do things
like:

		struct {
			struct fwnode_handle *fwnode;
		} fwnode;

If you're in doubt about that, think on how would you document
both fwnode structs. Both fwnode structs specify the match
criteria if %V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_FWNODE.

The same applies to this:

		struct {
			const char *name;
		} device_name;

Both device_name and name specifies the match criteria if
%V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_DEVNAME.

It is actually cleaner without the stucts.

Without the useless struct, if one wants to match a firmware node, it
should be doing:

 		pdata->asd[i]->match_type = V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_FWNODE;
		pdata->asd[i]->match.fwnode = of_fwnode_handle(rem);

And that' it. For anyone that reads the above code, even not knowing
all details of "match", is clear that the match criteria is whatever
of_fwnode_handle() returns.

Now, on this:

 		pdata->asd[i]->match_type = V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_FWNODE;
		pdata->asd[i]->match.fwnode.fwnode = of_fwnode_handle(rem);

It sounds that something is missing, as only one field of match.fwnode
was specified. Anyone not familiar with that non-conventional usage of
a struct with just one struct field inside would need to seek for the
header file declaring the struct. That would consume a lot of time for
code reviewers for no good reason.

The same apply for devname search:

In this case:
		asd->match_type = V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_DEVNAME;
		asd->match.device_name.name = imxsd->devname;

I would be expecting something else to be filled at device_name's
struct, for example to specify a case sensitive or case insensitive
match criteria, to allow seeking for a device's substring, or to
allow using other struct device fields to narrow the seek.

With this:

		asd->match_type = V4L2_ASYNC_MATCH_DEVNAME;
		asd->match.device_name = imxsd->devname;

It is clear that the match criteria is fully specified.

The duplicated "fwnode" name only made it more evident that we don't
need to enclose a single match criteria field inside a struct.
