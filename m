Hi Russell,

I tested this on 3430/n900 and 3530/Overo and it worked fine for
retention, but not for off.

Testing with off-mode, I found the MULTI_CPU path to be broken in
cpu_suspend (jumping to zero.)  Rebuilding for only OMAP3, it worked
fine for full-chip retention in suspend and idle as well as full-chip
off in suspend and idle.

I'm digging into the MULTI_CPU path now.

Kevin
