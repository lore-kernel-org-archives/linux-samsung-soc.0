I have to admit that I don't really like this approach, and I missed
the patch when originally posted (I did notice it in the pull request
it came in with though).

The main concern for me is that with a blanket "everything is always
unstable" we discard the notion that we should strive for bindings to
be stable and backwards compatible.

Questions that come to mind are:

 - When do they stop being unstable?
 - Is there a way to note in the binding itself that it's still
unstable with an anticipation of when it will be settled in?
 - Is there a better way to version the bindings to avoid complete
backwards compatibility?

Pointing out a couple of cases where it has been painful to stay
backwards compatible could also be useful for understanding (even
though you run the risk of each case being explained away with
suggestions of how it can be handled).
