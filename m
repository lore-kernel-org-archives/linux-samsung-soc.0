When disabling the samsung PWM the output state remains at the level it
was in the end of a pwm cycle. In other words, calling pwm_disable when
at 100% duty will keep the output active, while at all other setting the
output will go/stay inactive. On top of that the samsung PWM settings are
double-buffered, which means the new settings only get applied at the
start of a new PWM cycle.

This results in a race if the PWM is at 100% duty and a driver calls:
  pwm_config (pwm, 0, period);
  pwm_disable (pwm);

In this case the PWMs output will unexpectedly stay active, unless a new
PWM cycle happened to start between the register writes in _config and
_disable. As far as i can tell this is a regression introduced by 3bdf878,
before that a call to pwm_config would call pwm_samsung_enable which,
while heavy-handed, made sure the expected settings were live.

To resolve this, while not re-introducing the issues 3bdf878 (flickering
as the PWM got reset while in a PWM cycle). Only force an update of the
settings when at 100% duty, which shouldn't have a noticeable effect on
the output but is enough to ensure the behaviour is as expected on
disable.
