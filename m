Right, the XU3 has broken secure firmware such that MCPM cannot properly
control CCI, so CPUidle will hang when trying to hit low power states,
so you have to disable CCI by adding something like this to the end of
your XU3 .dts file:

&cci {
     status = "disabled";
};

For now, I've disabled CPUidle so we have a similar setup, but it
doesn't change anything on exynos5800-peach-pi

Then it seems something isn't quite right for exynos5800-peach-pi.
Below is the script[1] I'm using on exynos which also checks the voltage
by quering the regulator fwk (and optionally checking the INA2xx sensors
on odroid-xu3 if that support is enabled)

On your debug branch, it just gives -1 for all the voltages, so the
regulator voltage never changes:

# ./dvfs
CPU regulator: cpu0, vdd_arm, /sys/class/regulator/regulator.18
[   45.691483] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate: cpu: 0, old cluster: 0, new cluster: 0, freq: 200000
[   45.699581] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate_cluster: cpu 0, cluster: 0, 400 MHz, -1 mV --> 200 MHz, -1 mV
current freq: 200000 
current voltage: 1262500
[   46.969821] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate: cpu: 0, old cluster: 0, new cluster: 0, freq: 300000
[   46.978272] arm_big_little: bL_cpufreq_set_rate_cluster: cpu 0, cluster: 0, 200 MHz, -1 mV --> 300 MHz, -1 mV
current freq: 300000
current voltage: 1262500

I added a bit more debug to the cpufreq driver[1] and found that the
regulator_get_optional is failing:

[    3.407295] cpu cpu0: Unable to get regulator cpu-cluster.0
[    3.458282] cpu cpu4: Unable to get regulator cpu-cluster.1
