As far as I know (and I can read from the documentation), AFTR is a state 
in which program execution context (e.g. PC, CPU registers, etc.) is lost. 
This is like sleep mode, but with much more state saved (all the 
peripherals and L2 cache), which lets you resume much faster.

Based on that, the execution flow is as following:
 - kernel stops all secondary cores,
 - kernel configures PMU to enter AFTR mode,
 - WFI is executed on boot CPU, which lets PMU enter the requested low 
power mode,
 - the system stays with all CPU cores powered off until a wake-up event 
happens,
 - a wake-up event causes a wake-up reset of the boot CPU, which resumes 
operation from reset vector (usually IROM),
 - here exactly the same procedure is used as on wake-up from sleep mode, 
with the exception that some assumptions can be made about kept state, 
like BL1 being still in IRAM/SYSRAM, without the need to reload it from 
boot device,
 - after going through all the boot code, it finally jumps to the resume 
handler saved by kernel in one of those INFORM registers or somewhere in 
SYSRAM,
 - resume handler reinitializes boot CPU, restores things like MMU, 
coprocessors, etc. and finally boots secondary cores again,
 - the system is operating normally again.

This is simplified a lot, with all things happened internally in PMU and 
boot code skipped, but should give the general picture. See all the 
analogies to normal sleep mode, which (IMHO) makes it understandable that 
this mode can't be entered with more than one core active. 

However, with something like coupled cpuidle, when possible, this mode can 
be entered by powering down remaining cores automatically, so this is not 
a problem with this mode itself, but rather with current approach of 
entering it.

Best regards,
Tomasz
