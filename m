Hi Stephen,

Thanks for your comments.

Yes, I'm aware that parsing all those information from device tree won't be 
free. I have even considering simplifying the binding to something like

	samsung,pin-bank = <offset count func pud drv conpdn pudpdn>;

listing widths of fields in fixed order, with some fields allowed to be 
zero, meaning that given bank doesn't support this control. It would 
simplify the parsing to just iterating over a table under a single 
property. What do you think?

I have decided to post the original variant to get some comments earlier, 
as I already had all the rest of patches based on it.

Looking at the history of Samsung SoCs and specifics of this subsystem, 
there isn't much likely to change other than the bindings already account 
for (and the binding represents whatever the driver accounts for).

Correct me if I'm wrong, but each bank needs to have its own subnode to be 
able to address pins like this. That was the starting point of the whole 
series and the idea that if all the banks (which are SoC-specific) have to 
be defined anyway, maybe it wouldn't be too bad to put all the SoC-specific 
parameters there too.

Sorry about that. I thought the examples would be sufficient. Still, I was 
focused at getting comments about the idea of moving such data to DT in 
general, not the bindings, which are most likely to change, in particular.

Best regards,
