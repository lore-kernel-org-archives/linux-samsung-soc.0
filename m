Sounds good.

By the way, a random idea that just came to my mind is that since we 
already support multiple cpuidle drivers, what about providing a default 
cpuidle-wfi driver that gets used in case no other driver is available?

This would give us cpuidle stats at the same place as with other cpuidle 
drivers and might also unify some code paths.

As I said, it's just a random idea, so feel free to redirect it to 
/dev/null.

OK, looks good.
