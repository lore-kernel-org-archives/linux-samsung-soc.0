Ahh, now I see the approach.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think in principle these exynos
drivers don't use pm_runtime_set_active() during ->probe() and are
instead relying on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to be enabled.

That's not a good behaviour. If these drivers are build without
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME - they won't work.

I guess I have pointed out this in earlier discussions around runtime
PM, I have seen quite some driver's getting their support for runtime
PM wrong.

I see. Obviously we must not break exynos, let's try to figure out the
best way forward.

Thanks, I will have look and run some tests on exynos 5. Let you know soon.

You have two options:

1) Use/build Rafaels tree. Apply my patches on the bleeding edge
branch.That's also what I use a work base.
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm.git

2) Use/build Stephen Rothwell's linux-next tree. I can confirm the
patches applies on the master branch as of today.
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git

I really appreciate your help here, thanks!

You are right, but I am not sure we can do this in one go - since it
depends on if we can fix this on PM core of if we need need
adaptations in drivers/subsystems.

Kind regards
