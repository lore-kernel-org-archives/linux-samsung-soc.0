Yup, as near as I can tell this has been broken since (3146bee spi:
s3c64xx: Added provision for dedicated cs pin).  That landed June 25th
of 2013 into the SPI tree.

...so clearly nobody was really testing Samsung's SPI driver on ToT
Linux.  1 year of unnoticed brokenness seems like enough time that we
could do away with the old code.  If someone comes out of the woodwork
and claims a dire need to support the old binding then it can be added
then.

In-tree users of this appear to be:

arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4210-smdkv310.dts:
 cs-gpio = <&gpc1 2 0>;
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412-trats2.dts:
 cs-gpio = <&gpb 5 0>;
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5250-smdk5250.dts:
 cs-gpio = <&gpa2 5 0>;

...and I guess nobody has bothered using the SPI flash on those boards
for the last year?
