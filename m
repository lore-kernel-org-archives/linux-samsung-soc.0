How does the implementation know whether to ignore the offset for the
distributor or not?

How do you do it currently?

The issue with putting properties in the cpu node is it does not
scale. What if you had 10 per cpu properties on 10 different blocks.

Using the MPIDR directly is a bit specific. I would perhaps just do
something like this:

gic-cpu-map = <&CPU0 &CPU1>;
