Yeah, and I already apologized for missing the request :)

Your patch inserted almost 116 lines and most of the stuff was around
adding new bindings to get things working with cpufreq-dt driver.

And so I replied to the most important stuff, i.e. don't add new
bindings, we will sort it out with opp-v2.

And frankly that wasn't the time where we could have discussed how
exactly we are going to use it. Ofcourse we should get it via DT,
platform data is just not required.

So, me not NAK ing this approach was fine as it wasn't about keeping
this data in the platform data part.

I will say a month, as we discarded most of that patch recently :)

Its not about me doing some changes. But the whole point of doing the
opp-v2 thing was to get rid of such platform data things..

Just that your work is competing with opp-v2 code :)

I thought we can get your work to a better shape, with all credit to
you. But if you have some dependency on this for 4.3, then I don't
mind killing this structure after you have polluted it a bit more :)
