Okay, I guess it's common issue among maintainers. The problem with DT
is that it gets really hard to be fixed up later. :-)

Okay, I see.

To move forward in trying to make mmc pwrseq a generic pwrseq, could
we perhaps allow both cases?

In the mmc case, there are already deployed bindings so we need to
cope with these by using the phandle option, but for USB etc we could
force the child node option.
As long as we agree that we keep using a compatible string for the
child node as well, both options should be able to co-exist and we
should probably be able to managed them both from a common pwrseq
driver framework.

Although, I do remember from an older conversations around some of
mine submission for the mmc pwrseq code, that some people (maybe
Arnd?) wasn't keen on adding a new framework for this. Perhaps that
has changed?

Kind regards
Uffe
