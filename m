The reason I'm concerned about this is that I've had actual problems
with users of your out of tree BSPs getting confused by similar code
there.  Thinking about it some more it's not so much the fact that
the code is spread out as the fact that the the EPLL is so widely used
within the system that having one driver change it can easily disrupt
another subsystem in surprising ways.

Since the clock API currently doesn't have a good way of resolving this
perhaps a config option or something which masks the EPLL behaviour
controllable and leaves it alone by default?  That would show people how
to use this chip feature without affecting the other subsystems so
non-obviously.

This doesn't seem such a big deal - you could create a shared file for
the code under arch/arm.
