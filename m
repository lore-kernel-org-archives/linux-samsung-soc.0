This is a generic issue. Even if in your example, you can avoid this by
re-allocation and re-assignment (ignore the performance issue for such
behavior), the real question is the difficult to track all these down. =
Since
matrix_keypad_data is something out of your control (it was actually
drafted by me and Dmitry if you are interested), and think about one da=
y
I changed it's definition, now you have to sync your driver and code ev=
ery
time to make sure the discarded data is not referenced.
