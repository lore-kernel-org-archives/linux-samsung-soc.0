"It's not connected".  What do you mean?  If I were to guess I'd say
that on some particular board you're looking at they don't happen to
use the "CD" pin for card detect.  If this is what you mean, it
doesn't help me.  exynos5420-peach-pit does use the CD pin for card
detect.  You can look at the DTS file and confirm it.

...or are you saying that the CD pin somehow changes voltage domains
when configured as a GPIO?  I find that very hard to believe.  What
voltage domain does it go to?  If it goes to a 1.8V voltage domain
then that would be bad when vqmmc was 3.3V.  If it goes to a 3.3V
voltage domain then that would be bad when vqmmc was 1.8V.  Remember
that externally we've got a pull up to vqmmc.

Even if somehow magically we can read the card detect pin with vqmmc
off, we have an external pullup on this line that goes directly to the
"vqmmc" power rail.  If the vqmmc power rail is off then this external
pull up would not work and would actually act as an external pull down
if you could somehow configure the internal line to be a pullup.

When you say "exynos5", what do you mean here?  Do you mean the smdk
for 5250, or something else?
