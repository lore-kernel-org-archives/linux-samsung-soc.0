I agree that this race is hard to hit when running Linux on bare metal.

But consider a Linux kernel running as a guest OS.  Then the host might
preempt the guest in the middle of a tracepoint.  Then from the guest OS's
viewpoint, that VCPU has just stopped, possibly for a very long time --
easily long enough for all the other VCPUs to pass through quiescent
states.  And the guest OS is ignoring that VCPU, so a too-short grace
period could easily happen in this scenario.
