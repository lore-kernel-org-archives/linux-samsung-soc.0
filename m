Frankly we thought that if the only comments are reports that the 
patches fixed
the issue, there is no need to resend them without any change.

I also don't know why you think that the review from clock maintainers 
is needed.
Those patches modify power domain driver and implement the requirements from
exynos5422 technical note about power on/off procedures. The quality of 
technical
note is a different story (those requirements are not clearly stated 
there and
one need to collect them from different chapters). The patches were 
posted with
'RFC' tag, because we were not sure if they will fix the lockup issues 
on all
5420+ based boards, but after comments from others it looks that they 
are finally
the right approach.
