I'm not sure what's Mr Kukjin's opinion on that, but I personally would=
 really
like to see all the devname fields disappear from samsung clk data stru=
ctures.
Possibly if all involved people would keep that in mind we could achiev=
e this
over time.

OK, I was aware of that. I didn't mean removing the "mmc_busclk.2" entr=
ies,
just adding another 4, which are created anyway by s3c_register_clksrc(=
)
function. But for now I think the patch is OK.

I wouldn't do that. IMHO it's better to keep this patch as is, to make =
the final
diff size lower.
Perhaps it's even worth to consider doing the clock rename altogether i=
n this patch.
But it's of course up to you.
