Ok, but samsung,i2c-phy is much too generic. Maybe something like
samsung,exynos5-sata-phy  (and rename the MMIO-controlled phy controls
to ...sata-phy-controller below).

Wow, that's quite awkward. What needs to be done over i2c? I think I have
seen use of SATA without touching the i2c side but it might have been for
a simple setup.

It would be better to just make the i2c bus driver handle the case where there
is no interrupt specifier and just use polling in those cases, especially if
the rest of the device is identical and doesn't need special handling.

As a matter of fact, if that had been done for the hdmi phy, then you could
have done this patch without modifying the driver at all, just device tree
contents. And the same would go for the next time down the road when
a "special" i2c bus is added.
