One might also introduce optional functions and notify DMA engine core with
some flag that the client driver wants to use them or not. If not core will
prepare dma engine on initialization. This is not really nice from the API
clearness perspective, but it would allow to have some time for transition
to the new approach till all clients gets updated.

No, I don't have any example. This is just my fear that there might be some
hardware which works this way. I can imagine a driver, which queue dma 
engine
request and then triggers 'start' command to its hw block. HW blocks usually
uses some additional signal lines for DMA, so the HW block might check 
if all
needed signals from DMA engine HW are ready. If not it will fail to start
avoid lockup of starting without DMA engine HW being ready.

However I don't have much experience with DMA engine and drivers. I only
helped in adding DMA engine support to Samsung UART driver and in the
hardware manual there is information about additional lines between DMA
controller and UART module, which are used in the DMA mode.
