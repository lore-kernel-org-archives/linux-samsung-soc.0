No, I was specifically thinking about the various iPAQ specific things
like the additional platform specific ATAGs that they invented with
zero reference to mainline, and then expected them to be accepted as-is.

I gave them a very clear message over that (which was "no way") and that
was essentially the last of their mainline submissions.

improving, and getting towards what was expected from it.
