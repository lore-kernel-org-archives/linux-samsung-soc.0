The priority was initially chosen in such a way to do the emmc reset 
just before performing system reboot. I wanted let other possible 
handlers potentially use mmc if needed (although there is no such case 
atm). Now it turns that this approach was not the best idea, because 
there are other board-specific restart handlers with higher priority 
than the default I was using. IMHO the change proposed by Javier seems 
to be the best solution for now. The other possibility would be to 
entirely get rid of restart handler usage and wire this logic to 
mmc_shutdown(). This makes sense from the logical point of view, but the 
drawback of this solution is the lack of proper reset sequence in case 
of emergency reboot (shutdown callbacks are not called on emergency reboot).
