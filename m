Yes but upstream does it in a clean way, has support for platforms
requiring secure firmware operations and also implements coupled
AFTR mode on a few platforms.

I would be happy to help with reviewing patches etc. but personally
I don't have any plans for doing this work.  I may look into adding
support for newer ARM64 SoCs (Exynos5433) if I find some extra time
(quite unlikely currently).

This is a good question. Daniel/Lorenzo?
