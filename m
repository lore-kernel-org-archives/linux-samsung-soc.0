Two things here. Either we write proper code or we write code for
"believe it will work". There is a problem with second approach -
after some time, the driver will be developed further it your
assumptions might change... then stuff might get broken because no one
expected that driver data is discarded. Code working only with some
assumptions is a more difficult to maintain than code which is
correct.

In the same time if you believe your code is "correct" then just mark
samsung_pinctrl_dt_match initconst... Marking only few parts in the
chain is broken.

Second thing. How much memory you are saving? 5 kB in total? 10 kB? Is
it worth the risk?

That could work... but last time I asked for checking the return value
of match_data then you (I think) and Bartlomiej responded "no sense".
So please be consistent. Anyway it is not possible to NULL-ify the
match_data after first probe because samsung_pinctrl_dt_match is
const. This means you would have to add some crazy logic to check for
late (from overlays) or second probe and discard it... just because we
wanted to save some memory and marked initconst something referenced
from non-initconst section.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
