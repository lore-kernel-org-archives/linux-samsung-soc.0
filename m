Now that you put it that way, it does seem to have severe disadvantages.
Good thing I tagged the patches as RFC.  ;-)

Annoying, that.  I was hoping to get this fixed on an arch-by-arch basis.
Looks like it might have to be a global change requiring global agreement. :-(

After a call to rcu_idle_enter(), RCU ignores the CPU completely until the
next call to rcu_idle_exit().  This means that in the interval between
rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit(), you can say rcu_read_lock() all
you want, but your data structures will get absolutely no RCU protection.
This will result in random memory corruption, and for all I know might
already be resultin in random memory corruption.  So a fix is required.

So why does RCU need to ignore idle CPUs?  Because otherwise, RCU needs
to periodically wake them up to check their status.  Waking them up
periodically defeats CONFIG_NO_HZ's attempts to conserve power.  Avoiding
waking them up and avoiding ignoring them extended RCU grace periods,
eventually OOMing the systems.

Why this new imposition?  It is not new.  It has always been illegal to
use RCU in the idle loop from the beginning.  But people happily ignored
that restriction, partly because it is not always immediately obvious
what is using RCU.  Event tracing does, but unless you know that...

So we added diagnostics to check for illegal uses of RCU in the idle
loop, and also separated rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit() from
tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick(), so that things like idle notifiers can work.
The diagnostics promptly located all sorts of problems, including these.

The two options I see are:

1.	Rip tracing out of the inner idle loops and everything that
	they invoke.

2.	Push rcu_idle_enter() and rcu_idle_exit() further down into
	the idle loops.  As you say, -all- of them.

My patch set was an attempt at #2, but clearly a very poorly conceived
attempt.  But I had to start somewhere.

Other ideas?

							Thanx, Paul
