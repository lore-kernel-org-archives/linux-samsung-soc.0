Krzysztof has an Odroid XU3 lite and I have an Odroid XU4, both uses an
Exynos5422 so we can't check what's wrong with Odroid U3 (Exynos4412).

Having said that I think I know what is the issue here. Markus said that
he is using an eMMC instead of an uSD (which is what I used and my guess
is that Krzysztof did too).

Now, there is a subtle difference between the old PMU restart handler
and the syscon-reboot one, and that is the restart handler priorities:

notifier                    priority
------------------------------------
pmu_restart_notify          128
mmc_pwrseq_emmc_reset_nb    129
syscon_restart_handle       192

So, without Alim's patches, first the eMMC reset handler will be called
and then the PMU restart handler but after his series, the syscon reset
handler has a higher priority so the eMMC reset will never be called.

But the problem is that the eMMC card has to be properly reset on system
restart to allow the SoC iROM to be able to read the bootloader from the
eMMC since the iROM doesn't have restart logic and the card shouldn't be
left in an unknown state.

So the problem here is not that the system is not being reset (that I
think that works) but that on reboot, the system is not able to boot
again since the ROM is not able to read the second stage bootloader.

Markus, 

Can you please test following patch [0] on top of Alim's series? If that
works then it should either be part of Alim's series or the patches will
have to wait until that patch lands into mainline. I don't have an eMMC
to test it in XU4 but I'm pretty confident that it will solve the issue.

Best regards,

Subject: [RFT PATCH] mmc: pwrseq: Use highest priority for eMMC restart
 handler

The pwrseq_emmc driver does a eMMC card reset before a system reboot to
allow broken or limited ROM boot-loaders, that don't have an eMMC reset
logic, to be able to read the second stage from the eMMC.

But this has to be called before a system reboot handler and while most
of them use the priority 128, there are other restart handlers (such as
the syscon-reboot one) that use a higher priority. So, use the highest
priority to make sure that the eMMC hw is reset before a system reboot.
