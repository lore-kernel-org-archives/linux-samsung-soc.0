Usually static functions are put at beginning of a file and the
externally linkable ones (including exportable) are at the end. This
allows quick finding of what is exported by this unit.

Mixing static-nonstatic-static brings confusion/

This is a driver so everything except it is static, so I see two choices:
1. Put it in front, just after pmu_context definition.
2. Put it in back, just before the probe.

In drivers/power/reset there are already very-SoC-specific reset
handlers. All of them are non-reusable outside of some SoC family.
However I don't think it really matters - both locations (soc and power)
seem fine to me.

Looking at Bart's comments I see that you did not resolve all of them.
One was left:
"what happens if exynos_sys_powerdown_conf() is called
while there are no platform devices binded to a driver but driver itself
is loaded."

Looking at the code NULL pointer exception will happen on pmu_context
dereference.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
