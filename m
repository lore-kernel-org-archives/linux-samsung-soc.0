Hey, it is not my point.
To take kernel command line is not problem to support multiple LCDs.

My point is that s3c_fb_pd_win should not include variable LCD option.
So, if you want to support multiple LCDs, you should use another variable,
instead of using s3c_fb_pd_win[0] and s3c_fb_pd_win[1] as 4.3" LCD, 7.0" LCD.

You use s3c_fb_pd_win[0], s3c_fb_pd_win[1] as 4.3" LCD, 7.0" LCD.
However, s3c_fb_pd_win[0], s3c_fb_pd_win[1] means the windows of FIMD IP.
