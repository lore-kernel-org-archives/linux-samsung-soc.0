It's okay.

Please note that compatible strings and platform driver names are 
completely different things. There is no relation between them. 
Moreover, there are different rules (or recommendation) involved for 
creating both, so it's completely fine to add a compatible string of 
"samsung,s5pv210-secss", while keeping platform driver named "s5p-secss".

Let's see.

 From what I can find in various user's manuals, S5PV210 is the first to 
have the first variant, while Exynos4210 already has the new one.

S5PV210 does not support DT yet. Work is already in progress, but board 
file support will have to be retained for some time, so this driver 
should support non-DT probing too.

It doesn't affect my comment, though, as you can use of_match_ptr() macro.

I believe Sachin already explained this in his reply to your patch. 
Generally the driver from your link is supposed to always support DT, 
while this one can be built without DT support.

Best regards,
