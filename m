In patch 2/2 of this series, the platform code looks for nodes in
device tree that represent a power domain. When a power domain node is
found, a generic power domain is instantiated with pm_genpd_init()
using the information available from the node in device tree. There is
no automatic binding required in this case. The power domain node does
represent a hardware that manages the power domain.

A device node pointer or of_node pointer is a simple pointer to a
instance of a node in device tree. All nodes in a device tree need not
represent a corresponding 'struct device'. A node in device tree can
described a hardware feature such as a power domain supported in the
hardware.

The addition of device tree support for generic power domains in this
patchset is generic for all platforms. The platform code instantiates
generic power domains from device tree with the of_node pointer
assigned to 'struct generic_pm_domain'. Then, in
__pm_genpd_add_device(), given a of_node pointer (to gen_pd), it is
possible to find a matching power domain to select.

Thanks,
Thomas.
