Hello,

This series is rebased onto Ben Dook's framebuffer branch available at:
git://git.fluff.org/bjdooks/linux.git dev/s3c-fb

The main changes are the addition of an ability to wait for VSYNC and
display panning.

The first patch attempts to fix some NULL pointer dereferences in case
of a failed framebuffer memory allocation attempt. This is a quick
fix, so please treat it more as an indication of what may be wrong
with the code in the probe function and not as something to merge.

Patches 3-4 add "new style" device name initialization for various
S3C/S5P devices. The 4th patch also separates S5PC100 and S5PV210 as
their framebuffer registers sets differ.


[PATCH 1/6] s3c-fb: Fix various null references on framebuffer memory alloc failure
[PATCH 2/6] s3c-fb: Correct FRAMESEL1 bitfield defines for VIDINTCON0 register
[PATCH 3/6] s3c-fb: Add device name initialization.
[PATCH 4/6] s3c-fb: Separate S5PC100 and S5PV210 framebuffer driver data structures
[PATCH 5/6] s3c-fb: Add support for display panning
[PATCH 6/6] s3c-fb: Add wait for VSYNC ioctl

Best regards
