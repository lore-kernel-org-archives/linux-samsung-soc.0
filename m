Thanks for clarifying all the background details on the mmc changes.

Here is what I would conclude from the previous mail chain's.

1 Drop the cd-gpios changes. pinctrl-0 changes.

2 Fix the regulator changes for vmmc/vqmmc with disable of regulator-always-on;

3 Drop this UHS-I changes as if now.

Is this ok with you.
