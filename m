Tushar is right. In particular, there is absolutely no reason to
enforce driver selection based on platform enablement, as long as it
still builds no matter what (and if it doesn't, that should probably
be fixed).

It should be possible to enable a superset of all drivers, and only
have the ones that are actually instantiated by platform devices or
device tree entries probe and configure. That's how the kernel works
on nearly all platforms.


So, removing as much "depends on" as possible (probably only keep
SND_SOC_SAMSUNG here) seems like a good choice, and fixing any
compilation errors caused by it.
