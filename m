I agree. The shared spinlock as the interface between the two drivers
is clearly a hack, but I think it is an appropriate hack in this special
case and that's why I suggested using that over the more complex solutions
that Tomasz suggested.

The important part is that the DT binding reasonable and could support
more complex scenarios even though they are highly unlikely.
We can always change the kernel code to something else if we need to,
but I could not come up with good *and* simple design. The most obvious
solution would be to make the clocksource driver the master that exports
an interface to the pwm driver, but that just adds complexity for the
common case that just uses the pwm driver but not the clocksource driver.

The attempt to create a separate MFD glue driver that abstracts the
interface in the way that pwm-tiecap does also was a failure here, because
one of the two consumers has to run very early, before we have access to
most of the device infrastructure the kernel provides.
