I think the safest thing to do is for users to do both. You call
pwm_config() with a zero duty cycle to make it clear what the status is
that you want. Then you call pwm_disable() to state that you don't need
the output signal anymore, so that any clocks needed by the PWM can be
stopped. Doing so gives the driver the most information and should make
the user more resilient against any possible quirks in drivers.

Drivers that on pwm_disable() still invert the signal should still be
fixed, though. In the cases that I'm aware of the sequence of setting
the duty cycle to 0 and calling pwm_disable() won't actually paper over
any bugs. It's precisely that sequence that triggers the bug. Merely
calling pwm_disable() should trigger it as well, pwm_config(0) without
pwm_disable() would hide it.
