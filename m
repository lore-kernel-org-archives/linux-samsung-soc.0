Hi Chris, Kyungmin

I'd like to let you know that Ben had reviewed and commented for
"[PATCH v2 2/2] sdhci-s3c: Add support no internal clock divider" in host
controller in 9/21. However, our response was late due to our holidays. I
made a response in 9/28 that why we use this quirk and now we're waiting for
his opinion.

Kyungmin, did you check Ben's review comments for this ? When I saw it, his
approach is just a bit different from you and me. Please let us know if you
have any idea about his comments.

Thanks,
Best Regards
Jeongbae Seo
