I'm considering about your comment about hierarchy.

But, I think it is not appropriate.
there is no perfect paired set between sub-block and dvfs driver for AM=
BA bus.

=46or example about Exynos5420's JPEG IP,
There are two JPEG IPs in the Exynos5420. But two JPEG IPs
use the same source clock for AMBA AXI line to transfer
data between DRAM and JPEG as following:

(AXI master)               (AXI slave)
JPEG_0 --|-----(AXI)-----|
         |               |---- DRAM
JPEG_1 --|-----(AXI)-----|

Two AMBA buses use the same source clock. So, only one dvfs driver
should handle the source clock for AXI bus.
              =20
Also,
two JPEG use the same AMBA APB line to configure the register of JPEG I=
P
as following:

(APB slave)                 (APB master)
JPEG_0 --|-----(APB)-----|
         |               |---- CPU
JPEG_1 --|-----(APB)-----|

The JPEG_0/1 could not be included in both AXI and APB in Device Tree.

Additionally, the I2C/SPI/PCI and etc use the APB bus
for communication between each controller and CPU.

I'll expect your reply.

Chanwoo Choi
