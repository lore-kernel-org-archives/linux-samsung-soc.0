Sure, but the xres and yres tell the _input_ resolution, i.e. how many
pixels are read from the memory. What is missing is the _output_
resolution, which is the size of the window. These are not necessarily
the same, if the system supports scaling.

Nothing wrong with adding x/y offsets, but the problem is in configuring
the two overlays. If the framebuffer data is used by two overlays, each
overlay should be configured separately. And your ioctl does not have
any way to define which overlay is being affected.

Of course, if we specify that a single framebuffer will ever go only to
one output, the problem disappears.

However, even if we specify so, this will make the fbdev a bit weird:
what is x/yres after this patch? In the current fbdev x/yres is the size
of the output, and x/yres are part of video timings. After this patch
this is no longer the case: x/yres will be the size of the overlay. But
the old code will still use x/yres as part of video timings, making
things confusing.

And generally I can't really make my mind about adding these more
complex features. On one hand it would be very nice to have fbdev
supporting overlays and whatnot, but on the other hand, I can't figure
out how to add them properly.
