And I'm saying that's not the answer primarily because we should never require
people to update their firmware to get a usable linux system.

And I am strongly NAK:ing both of those approaches. We should not require
a single out-of-tree patch because that means we have failed to make a useful
kernel for people. And it should never, ever, be a requirement for people to
reflash and risk bricking their device just to run mainline linux on it. It's
an artificial barrier of entry with high risk, and we'll be worse off for
adding it. Same for out-of-tree patches.

iRAM is covered on Doug's sub-thread, and I think his approach looks promising.
So, it seems like we have a solution both to enable the CCI port and to avoid
clearing iram -- we should be set?
