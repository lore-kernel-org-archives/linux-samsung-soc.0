Given my self proclaimed lack of SD/MMC knowledge, if others have a
good reason for doing them separate then you should do it that way.
So far I haven't heard that reason but I certainly could be wrong.

Can you explain more about what's failing?  It sure looks like mmc
core is supposed to handle this given comments below

/*
* If we're using a fixed/static regulator, don't call
* regulator_set_voltage; it would fail.
*/
voltage = regulator_get_voltage(supply);

if (!regulator_can_change_voltage(supply))
  min_uV = max_uV = voltage;
