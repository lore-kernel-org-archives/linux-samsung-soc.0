Not yet, but as I mentioned, I have only above mentioned 7 patches
atop kukjin's for-next.
only difference is the patch " ARM: EXYNOS: Use MCPM call-backs to
support S2R on Exynos5420"
which I had rebased myself.

I am out of office till 7th October, once I am back, I can send you
all those 7 patches, config file and S2R log.

Can you confirm that the system has really suspended, I mean can you
measure VDD_EGL or VDD_KFC and check or by any other method you know
of.

I too tested on 5420 based peach-pit board with exynos_defconfig +
disabled CONFIG_BL_SWITCHER.

It did suspend and resume gracefully.
