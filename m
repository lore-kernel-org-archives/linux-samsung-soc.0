Ok.

The sdhci bus width binding is an example that can be extended as you
have suggested. If done this way, the sdhci bus width bindings would
be converted by the driver to either of MMC_CAP_[4/8]_BIT_DATA
capability.

But there are other MMC_CAP_XXX values as well which the host
controller driver needs to report to the upper mmc core layer. Some of
these capabilities are determined by reading caps register of the host
controller and converting them to equivalent MMC_CAP_XXX flags. But
some of them are board dependent such as

MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL,
MMC_CAP_DISABLE,
MMC_CAP_NONREMOVABLE,
MMC_CAP_POWER_OFF_CARD and others.

These flags which are tied to the characteristics of the board is
usually supplied using platform data. The driver picks up these from
platform data, adds its own set of CAP's and reports to the upper
layer.

When we do not have platform data (as in the case of dt), there could
be two options to bind these CAP's. Either define custom bindings for
these and then translate them in each host controller driver using
them or provide direct bindings for MMC_CAP_xxx with a common function
to parse them. I tend towards direct bindings for MMC_CAP_XXX because
it can be used by any type of mmc/sd host controller and not just
sdhci controller and provides common binding for all host controllers.

Thanks for your comments.

Thomas.
