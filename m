Do you have to use 2 cells for address? Cannot it be:
 			ranges = <0 0x04000000 0x20000
 				  1 0x05000000 0x20000
 				  2 0x06000000 0x20000
 				  3 0x07000000 0x20000>;

Put compatible and reg at beginning.

Good, I like your approach.

Re-using reg-io-width seems fine. In future, if needed, this can be
extended by introducing bank-width but now there is no sense in it.

For timings - OK. PMC is separate. This is not a timing.

You need to document them. We are not gonna put some data looking like a
vendor blob into the binding. I understand that document has
confidential mark... all of Samsung datasheets I've seen had it. I don't
find it as problem but of course I am not the one to judge here. If you
do not feel comfortable publishing such data, get an approval from your
manager. You can also try to search for this in vendor code
(opensource.samsung.com). If it is published there, then this won't be a
disclosure.

Ok, array for timings, but PMC IMHO is different.

BTW, your email client is weird. You are sending non-wrapped emails
without format=flowed in Content-Type. Please stick to mailing list
convention of wrapping at 72-char. It is really difficult to read your
replies.
