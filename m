So after a conversation with Tomasz Figa over IRC the problem was after all that
the pin was reconfigured. The IRQ trigger type resulted to be just a red herring
and not a direct cause.

The pinctrl-eyxnos driver does the IRQ pinmux setup in the .irq_set_type
function handler. So what happened was that OF parsed the "interrupts" property
and called exynos_irq_set_type() which did the pinmux setup.

But after that, due a DTS pinctrl configuration the pin function was changed as
a GPIO input and that happened before the atmel driver was probed. So when the
driver called request_threaded_irq(), the correct flags were used but the pin
was not configured as an IRQ anymore so IRQ were not fired.

Setting a trigger type just had the side effect of calling exynos_irq_set_type()
which again setup the pin as an IRQ.

To fix the issue a variation of patch [0] will be posted that moves the IRQ
pinmux setup from .irq_set_type to the .irq_request_resources function handler.
That way the pin will be setup as IRQ regardless of the the trigger type [1]
when someone calls request_[threaded]_irq().

Only the mentioned patch fixes the issue but Tomasz said that even a call to
gpio_direction_{input,output} can change the pin configuration so he will post
another patch that will add a bit mask to samsung_pin_bank to prevent any pinmux
reconfiguration.

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
