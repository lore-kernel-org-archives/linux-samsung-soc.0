Right.

OK.

Well, clk_ignore_unused seems a bit too coarse grained to me. Also
forcing the user to add it in his bootloader (or any other way) is not
really the best practice IMHO.

At least for next 3.17-rc I'd suggest fixing this up in respective clock
driver and dropping the hack only after Exynos DRM patches are merged
and confirmed working.

Best regards,
