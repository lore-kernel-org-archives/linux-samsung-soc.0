I don't follow the purpose of this patch.

There's no way we can remove kernel-side support for "arm,amba-bus", as
there are DTBs that rely on it.

If we're going to merge "arm,amba-bus" in the kernel with "simple-bus",
such that there is no distinction between the two, then that doesn't
require any DTBs to be updated.

The only reason I would see for changing dts files would be a subsequent
clean-up for consistency, but at that point "arm,amba-bus" could be
dropped entirely.

So this patch makes no sense to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
