The clocks SCLK_APLL, SCLK_HPM, ATCLK and PCLK_DBG have no relation to
the ARMCLK frequency. These clocks are directly derived from the PLL
clock and so it would not be correct to have them related to ARMCLK.

So, I see two solutions to this, first being preferred solution.

[A] Cell #1 should define PLL (parent of armclk) clock speed. Cell #2
and Cell #3  should define divider values for ARMCLK clock speed. The
hardware does support PLL frequency != ARMCLK frequency and so DT
binding should allow that (even though implementation in the linux
kernel does not use this feature). BTW, this was what was done in v2
of this series.

[B] Embedded this data with the code and don't get this from DT. The
reason for doing this is, these are SoC specific values and not board
specific. And when we are clear about what we want to put in DT, have
a provision to lookup DT first and if DT values are not found,
fallback on data embedded with the code.

Thanks,
Thomas.
