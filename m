I will fix the commit message.

Earlier around v4.2 detection of UHS-I card was not working,but now it
seen to work in v4.4 kernel.
May be some driver issue which might have been fixed.

I am just trying to set the voltage range for LDO13 from 1.8V (min) to
2.8V (max).
If setting this is wrong according to datasheet then I will drop this setting.
