Thanks for review!
I will include the Acks in the next patchset.
I will post the next patchset with corrections by the day after tomorro=
w.

And sorry for late reply.
I had holidays for the new year's day based on Lunar system.

OK.
BTW, Isn't it a problem when a device driver does not know that its
iommu domain is destroyed?
Can we regards that it is the faulty use of iommu API?

Yes, I wanted to avoid repeated function call by iommu_map().
s5p_iommu_map() maps once for the same page size since it is efficient
and simple.
That's why this driver initializes domain->pgsize_bitmap with 0xFFFFF00=
0
even though our IOMMU driver just supports 3 different page sizes
including 4KB, 64KB and 1MB.

Do you think it is better for s5p_iommu_map() to map just one page at o=
nce?

If a region to unmap consists of tens of pages
there is no way to avoid flushing IOTLB repeatedly.

Out iommu driver doesn't need to flush IOTLB more than once for a
region to unmap.

Do you think the driver is better to unmaps just one page at once
though flushing IOTLB repeatedly?


Thank you.
