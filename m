I suspect Trustzone would prohibit to access SSS IP. I never tested it =
Exynos
hwrng under Trustzone enabled,
however some said it cannot be used manually after being protected by S=
ecure OS.

And I don't know neither how to check whether Trustzone is enabled.
Can you access all other registers in SSS IP? If not, it might be relat=
ed with it.

Thanks.
