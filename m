In the current code we did not set the mode to UNUSED but only call
set_mode callback function for the clock event device. This normally
disables current clock event device. The dying CPU eventually will
switch to idle thread, call tick_nohz_idle_enter(), try to cancel the
sched_timer and reprogram the next event. Then set_next_event() gets
called. The call stack will be like:

tick_nohz_idle_enter
  -> __tick_nohz_idle_enter
    -> tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick
      -> hrtimer_cancel
        -> hrtimer_try_to_cancel
          -> remove_hrtimer
            -> __remove_hrtimer
              -> hrtimer_force_reprogram
                -> tick_program_event
                  -> clockevents_program_event
                    -> set_next_event

In set_next_event() we'll re-enable and re-program the clock event device.
