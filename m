This patch series cleans up the GIC code, consolidating some of the
per-platform practices into the common GIC code.

One notable change is to the initialization methods - we used to
require platforms to pass in the address of the per-CPU interfaces
despite them always being identical between all cores.  This was
nonsense, as even in the extremely unlikely event that they were
different, we aren't storing them in a per-CPU manner.

The GIC initialization methods are now simpler: one call to gic_init()
from the boot CPU, and a call to gic_secondary_init() as each
secondary CPU starts - and no need for platforms to keep track of
the address anymore.

One question remains on this: on platforms where there are more than
one GIC, do these have separate CPU interfaces as well?

We also consolidate gic_cpu_base_addr to save platforms using that -
but only for the first GIC, and therefore we can have a common
get_irqnr_preamble assembler macro for platforms which make use of
this.

Lastly, we move the GIC data to __read_mostly - and when we have
support for this feature, we benefit from avoiding potential cache
line ping-pongs between cores for data so marked.
