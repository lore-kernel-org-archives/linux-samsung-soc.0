Andrzej is on holidays right now, so he won't be able to reply in this
thread until he's back. Here are two patches I was able to find on the
related MLs that might be fixing the cause of your issues:

[PATCH] drm/exynos: remove hardware overlays disable from fimd probe
(https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-samsung-soc@vger.kernel.org/msg31629.html)

[PATCH] drm/exynos: fimd: Keep power enabled during fimd_bind
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/4/188)

Best regards,
Tomasz
