Commit 43f3408261a2 ("rtc: s3c: Document required clocks in the DT
binding") added to the S3C binding doc the required clocks needed
by the Real Time Clock but the S3C driver supports different HW IP
and only the s3c6410 needs a source clock.

Fix the DT binding explaning that the second clock is only needed
by this IP block and not for the others.

Hello,

The mentioned commit was picked by Rob Herring so this one has to go
through his tree again and not through the RTC tree to avoid conflicts.

Best regards,
Javier
