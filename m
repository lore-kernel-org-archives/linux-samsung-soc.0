Right. That's obviously not an acceptable behaviour, we can do better.

I agree with Rafael and Sylwester, that it would be an advantage if PM
domains can be initialized in powered off state. Simply because, those
may then be left in powered off state all the time, if they are
unused.

That's been my long term approach, but let's see if we can get there
without the intermediate step proposed in this patchset...

Now, to support the above and to solve the race conditions, we need to
be able to power up the PM domain, prior probing of a device. I am
thinking of a solution aimed to affect subsystem level code (buses)
and not drivers, since we need keep the impact on a reasonable level.

Let's see what I will come up with. I have some ideas that I am trying out...

I understand.

I guess another valid argument is the kernel configuration. The
corresponding driver which normally would handle the device may
intentionally not even been build into the kernel. Certainly we must
not leave those unused PM domains in powered up state.

That would have been great, but I won't be there. Unless I schedule a
last minute trip. :-)

Kind regards
