I don't find the argument of performance penalty such important but for
the sake of design, the samsung-specific code could be moved to
drivers/soc/samsung/pm_domains.c, called "legacy_pm_parse" and exported
through a header. Thus with !ARCH_EXYNOS that would be 'static inline
{}'.  However that is not a nice solution - there will be still
direct call to platform-specific code in the core. I am not sure if it
is worth the effort.

The samsung,power-domain was made deprecated (although not explicitly)
in January 2015 (0da658704136 ("ARM: dts: convert to generic power
domain bindings for exynos DT")) so how about:
1. Printing a dev_warn() about usage of deprecated bindings.
2. Complete removal in January 2017?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
