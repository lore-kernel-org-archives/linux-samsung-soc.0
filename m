The function prepares the checkable list and not only checks if packing=
 is
possible, therefore I think its name should change to reflect its real
action.

Having the condition with a && can lead to cases where CMD23 is not=20
supported and we send packed commands. Therfore the condition should be
changed to || or be splitted to 2 separate checks.
Also, according to the standard the generic error flag in
PACKED_COMMAND_STATUS is set in case of any error and having
PACKED_EVENT_EN is only optional. Therefore, I don't think that setting
the packed_event_en should be a mandatory condition for using packed
coammnds.

Can you please explain this condition and its purpose?

Ideally, you'd need to pack all neighbouring requests into one packed
command.

In order to better utilize the packed commands feature and achieve the
best performance improvements I think that the command packing should b=
e
done in the block layer, according to the scheduler policy.
That is, the scheduler should be aware of the capability of the device =
to
receive a request list and its constrains (such as maximum number of
requests, max number of sectors etc) and use this information as a  fac=
tor
to its algorithm.
This way you keep the decision making in the hands of the scheduler whi=
le
the MMC layer will only have to send this list as a packed command.

It would be best to keep all the calls to blk_fetch_request in the same
location. Therefore, I suggest to move the call to mmc_blk_chk_packable=
 to
mmc/card/queue.c after the first request is fetched.

This should be the case for MMC_PACKED_NONE.

Do we need the while or should it be an if? In other cases where
__blk_end_request is called there is no such while.
