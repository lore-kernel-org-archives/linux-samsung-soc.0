IMO it is safe to assume such devices have slim chances to become the majority.
The 'extra' parameters will be present in every instance of the IP
in the SoCs that have them, only their value may differ. So, why not
define a new structure with fields for such 'extra' parameters for such
devices and make them available to drivers from platform_data.
That will :-
 a) Keep the original and simple design of Ben Dooks intact.
 b) Avoid taking space more than needed for majority of 'simple' devices.

People might later want to build and load drivers for 'unused' device ?

Also, since there is already underway a good effort towards unifying
kernel builds for different platforms at ARM level, it might be worthwile
to look at the problem from POV vaster than Samsung. And then,
implement only Samsung specific need to work with that stub.

my 2 cents.
