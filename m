MDMA1 can support both secure and non-secure AXI transactions, the
actual behaviour is controlled by trustzone software. It may be the
case that MDMA1 is configured to be used in secure mode only, hence
accessing it in non-secure mode is causing the oops.

Right now, the only solution looks like disabling this node in
Arndale-Octa dts file.

If it works, I will submit this patch.
