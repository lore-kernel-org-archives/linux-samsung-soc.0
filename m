Sure, I'll document this.

OK.

OK, I can merge this into one suspend_disable.

Yes, I'll add it.

I looked at them. In this patchset I didn't want to implement fully the
whole suspend-mode-thing. Just the first, easier part - set suspend
disable.

In general I would like to do it similar to your solution but that is
work for future. Especially as I would like to wait for merging your
"Add max77802 regulator operating mode support".
