You haven't answered this question.

I know that Odroid XU3 have both LEDs connected to GPIO and
PWM lines but that should be mentioned in the commit message.

Yes, because exynos_defconfig as everything as built-in to
make it easier for developers to test by only copying the
kernel image and not the modules.

If a patch has a typo, an extra blank line or something
very easy to fix then it may be possible that the maintainer
will do the fix when applying but changing the commit message
I think is too much so in this case is better to resend IMHO.
