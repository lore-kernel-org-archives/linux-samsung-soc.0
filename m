OK. I see, there are quite a few places these definitions are scattered
even though not used (not used in the sense what ever values these
macros are taking in code it's not used). Such as
mach-exynos/include/map.h, plat-samsung/include/plat/{map-s3c.h,
map-s5p.h} and mach-s3c24xx/include/mach/map.h. So I will remove all
these in one go.
Is this fine?
Also I have one doubt in case I am touching files across various mach
files and preparing a single patch what should be commit message
heading? Is commit starting with "ARM: samsung" fine? or anything more
appropriate you would suggest.
