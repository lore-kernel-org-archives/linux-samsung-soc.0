We discussed this in private (we work in the same office) and I pointed
out certain issues with Sylwester's proposed implementation and we
agreed that one more revision of the patch is needed, but as it happens,
higher priority tasks showed up and this one got lost in action.

The first version of the patch [1] changed the original behavior
breaking DT ABI compatibility and relied on improper assumption that
those clocks are always in "fixed-rate-clocks" node. The thing is that
no code should rely on DT node naming.

Second version [2] was much better in this aspect, but it had some minor
implementation issues - custom clk_ops used instead of generic mux clock
and chipid block being constantly mapped and unmapped in every call to
__fin_pll_mux_get_parent().

I should have reviewed them both on the mailing lists, but at that time
there was no major activity related to Exynos4 outside of our office, so
it was more convenient to just talk together directly.

Anyway, I don't think this is all relevant to Exynos5410, which just
uses the generic fixed rate binding and has the thing done right from
the start.

Best regards,
Tomasz
