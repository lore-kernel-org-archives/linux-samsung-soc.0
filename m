So the second(?) patch "[PATCH v4] Samsung: add new card detection
methods in s3c-sdhci driver (platform part)" has already been applied
to linux-next by Kukjin Kim, along with modifications which we have not
been shown.  

But the first patch
(sdhci-s3c-add-support-for-the-non-standard-minimal-clock-value.patch)
has not been applied to linux-next by anoyne and the third patch
"[PATCH v4] sdhci-s3c: add support for new card detection methods
(driver part)" has not been applied either.

This is a complete mess.  What happens if I apply and merge
sdhci-s3c-add-support-for-the-non-standard-minimal-clock-value.patch
and
sdhci-s3c-add-support-for-new-card-detection-methods-driver-part.patch?
I have no idea.

I think I'll just drop all of it.  Please sort all of this out then let
me know what you want me to do.
