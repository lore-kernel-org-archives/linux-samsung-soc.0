You can upgrade any property change to an atomic modeset by e.g.
setting connector->mode_changed (and then making sure to call
check_modeset() helper again perhaps). This is for cases where your hw
can't handle a property change within 1 vblank. The default is just
the solution for most common hw.

The other way round works too, you can clear these flags in your
atomic_check callbacks. But that requires a bit more care (to make
sure you never clear it when there's something else also changing that
still needs a full modeset sequence to commit to hw).
