From: Daniel Kurtz <djkurtz@chromium.org>

Usually, the i2c controller has finished emitting the i2c STOP before the
driver reaches the bus idle polling loop.  Optimize for this most common
case by reading IICSTAT first and potentially skipping the loop.

If the cpu is faster than the hardware, we wait for bus idle in a polling
loop.  However, since the duration of one iteration of the loop is
dependent on cpu freq, and this i2c IP is used on many different systems,
use a time based loop timeout (5 ms).

We would like very low latencies to detect bus idle for the normal
'fast' case.  However, if a device is slow to release the bus for some
reason, it could hold off the STOP generation for up to several
milliseconds.  Rapidly polling for bus idle would seriously load the CPU
while waiting for it to release the bus.  So, use a partial exponential
backoff as a compromise between idle detection latency and cpu load.
