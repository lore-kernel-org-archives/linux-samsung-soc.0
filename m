It seems this patch breaks my S3C2416 based machine with 3.7-rc1. I'm not 
yet sure why, but the only response I get is loop of:

	mmc0: Timeout waiting for hardware interrupt.
	mmc0: Internal clock never stabilised.
	mmc0: Timeout waiting for hardware interrupt.
	mmc0: Internal clock never stabilised.


This only happens on the hsmmc channel using the gpio-based card detect and 
even prevents the card from beeing fully detected. The other hsmmc channel 
using a permanent emmc seems to be working fine.

And of course, when I revert this patch everything works fine again.

I'll investigate further, but it'd be also ok if someone has a fix for this 
before me :-) .
