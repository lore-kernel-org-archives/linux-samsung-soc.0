Again, I think this is more of a consequence of people adding the config they
use (which as you said in most cases is just built everything in the kernel to
avoid copying modules) than something that was made on purpose.

I'll repost with =y for exynos_defconfig but I really think that for
multi_v7_defconfig we should have everything as a module if possible. It's just
3.6 kB but if every single platform do the same the kernel will be quite bloated
for little gain.
