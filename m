Can you verify that you can't re-route these signals to GPIOs on your
Exynos board, especially for wp and cd?

That would mean, you don't need the internal logic of the dw_mmc to
get either card detect or write protect, which would solve your
problem.

I am not sure I follow to understand the problem. All I am saying is:
>From your ->set_ios() when you get MMC_POWER_UP, enable vcc and vccq.

The rest is taken care of from mmc core, when trying to initialize the card.

On what level of current leakage did you measure?

In an system PM suspend state we are chasing uA; I find it hard that
no leakage is added when the power is enabled. Anyway, let's leave
that as a separate discussion. :-)

Kind regards
