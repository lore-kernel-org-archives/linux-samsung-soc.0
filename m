For background: With e.g.:

samsung,func-width = <4>;
samsung,pud-width = <2>;
samsung,drv-width = <2>;

How do you know if the layout is:

bits:    7-4  | 3-2 | 1-0
meaning: func | pud | drv

or:

bits:    7-6 | 5-4 | 3-0  |
meaning: drv | pud | func |

or:

bits:    15-12 | 13-8   | 7-6 | 5-3    | 2-1 | 0
meaning: func  | unused | pud | unused | drv | unused

I suppose what you're saying is that for all currently extant Samsung
SoCs, there's some rule that defines this; perhaps the fields are always
in order MSB to LSB func, pud, drv, and there are never any unused bits
between the fields? If so, I suppose that's reasonable, even if it does
restrict the binding's ability to support any unanticipated future SoC
register layout changes.

With the DT properties just defining "width", the driver still has to
calculate the pos from every width by adding up the widths of all fields
lower in the register, right? Or, does each field always start at a
hard-coded bit position?

Anyway, you could completely avoid this question by using masks instead:

samsung,func-mask = <0xf0>;
samsung,pud-mask = <0xc>;
samsung,drv-mask = <0x3>;

The mask defines exactly which bits are included in the register field,
so it implicitly defines both the position and width of the field.

Finding the shift/size is very easy. I believe Tony Lindgren's generic
pinctrl already does this along these lines. Very roughly:

func_pos = ffs(func_mask);
func_width = ffs(~(func_mask >> func_pos));

The problem with that is that if the datasheet documents "func" values
of 0, 1, 2, 3, whereas your driver expects values that are shifted left
one bit in order to fit into the field, the DT would need to contain 0,
2, 4, 6. So, the DT values then don't match the documentation, which
would end up being confusing.

OK, the HW is nice and consistent then. In that case, the binding is
probably reasonable. Hopefully the HW designers are aware they shouldn't
randomly break the uniformity!
