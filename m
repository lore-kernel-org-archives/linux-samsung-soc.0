I also don't have an Arndale board and haven't followed the thread to closely
but I just wanted to mention that the ChromiumOS 3.8 tree has a workaround to
reset the HSIC phys:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/81685c447954a29d1098268776582457258dd98f%5E%21/

and later a "supports-hsicphy-reset" DT property was added to force the reset
per board instead of unconditionally:

https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/a4d1c1a223ffa1ed38a4257d0378ca70c6667be0%5E%21/
