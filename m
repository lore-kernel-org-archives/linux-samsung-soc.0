This series should be split in a different way, because patch 1/2 breaks 
dwmmc on Exynos5250 and only patch 2/2 fixes this, so bisection is broken.

Also patch 2/2 contains two logically separate changes - moving dwmmc nodes 
and making status disabled by default. Those should be in separate patches.

Best regards,
Tomasz
