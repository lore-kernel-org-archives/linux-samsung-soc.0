Ok, then save it then, as no one could have used it before then, right?

All I don't want to see is any "get by name/void *" functions in the
api, as that way is fragile and will break, as people have already
shown.

Just pass the real pointer around.  If that is somehow a problem, then
something larger is a problem with how board devices are tied together :)
