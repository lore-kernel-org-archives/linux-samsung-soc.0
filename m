It doesn't. The problem is that using pm_runtime_get_sync() in this
path is not working.

Now, I failed to include some of the important information from
previous discussions around this patchset. Let me iterate the patchset
with better commit messages, but let's first continue this thread.

Here are some of the previous discussion:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&m=141270897014653&w=2
http://marc.info/?l=linux-pm&m=141208104729597&w=2

Below is a summary of why I think "pm_runtime_get_sync()" isn't working for us.

1)
It's bad practice to use pm_runtime_get_sync() in the ->probe() path,
to bring your resources to full power. The consequence would be a
driver that requires CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME to be even functional, which
just isn't acceptable.

Drivers that behaves well within this context, follows the runtime PM
documentation/recommendation. They use pm_runtime_set_active() during
->probe() to reflect that their devices are fully powered and capable
of handling I/O.

You may also have a look at these discussions which also touches this
topic, but within a context of another patchset.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/23/95

2)
Another good example why pm_runtime_get_sync() is a bad solution to
our problem, is the amba bus. Before it invokes the driver's ->probe()
callback it does the following.
- "enable bus clock"
- pm_runtime_get_noresume()
- pm_runtime_set_active()
- pm_runtime_enable()

For these scenarios a pm_runtime_get_sync() from any of amba driver's
->probe() callback wouldn't have any effect, since the device is
already active. In other words, the resources needs to be "manually"
enabled.


Kind regards
Uffe
