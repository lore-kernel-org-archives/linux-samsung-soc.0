I agree for the wakeup source, but I need to go through the irqchip core
again to understand this better.

It also takes re-enables all the IRQs in the resume path that were
disabled on the suspend path.

As I mentioned above this happens for all non-wake up interrupts.
However this needs to done for wake up interrupts IIUC. BTW if these
registers are lost assuming the combiner was powered down, even the
status register will be lost and you will not know exactly the wakeup
reason right ?

IIRC these combiner feeds to main interrupt controller and you need to
make sure that interrupt is set as wakeup if required. Right ? so you
may still need irq_set_wake IMO.
