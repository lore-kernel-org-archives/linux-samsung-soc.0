No that's not the problem, I used the latest... but:

This was the problem, so making new build rules now
to see if I can catch this.

Unfortunately it cannot live right under mach-s3c24xx because there
are drivers here and there referring directly to the contents of this
file.

The only quick-fix option would be to move it back to
<mach/gpio-samsung-s3c24xx.h>
but the real solution is of course to augment all drivers to use
gpio descriptors and add descriptor tables to the boardfiles.

I'm a bit reluctant to do that as I'd prefer to be able to test
such modifications on HW ... plus time may be better invested
in DT migration (as I think is the conclusion of this thread
eventually).

A bit more: if you look in drivers/gpio/gpio-samsung.c you see
bank base GPIO offset for each bank into the global scope
*and* the number of GPIOs for each bank propagated from
machine headers instead of using platform data.

Again the proper solution (if the boardfiles are kept) is to switch
to using a GPIO descriptor table. Or using DT.

Samsungs <plat/gpio-cfg.h> is basically a custom legacy pin
control implementation.

The real solution to getting rid of that file is to switch over
to using pinctrl-[samsung|s3c24xx] which as Heiko describes
mandates also using DT, and thus blocks attempts
at using this path for fixing the legacy boardfiles.

It's one of these situations where we end up with an
all-or-nothing conversion path: either you change everything
over to device tree or everything stays in two copies ...
I'm trying to refactor the existing board files here maybe
that is in vain :-/ as GPIO maintainer I want to get rid of
<mach/gpio.h>.

I was wrong about this, too much in my head. As Tomasz says,
pinctrl-samsung can be used, but mandates that everything is
moved over to device tree.

Probably the best thing now that I have one problem less is to
leave it to the S3C maintainers to complete their DT migration?
