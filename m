This is the least bad option I've come up with. It brings back
early_init_dt_add_memory_arch so we can use arm_add_memory and stop
adding memory if it reaches an upper threshold. I was debating setting
the default at 12 or 8 but setting at 12 seems like it would involve the
fewest platform changes.

Thanks,
Laura

Subject: [PATCH] arm: Add back maximum bank limit

Commit 1c2f87c22566cd057bc8cde10c37ae9da1a1bb76
(ARM: 8025/1: Get rid of meminfo) dropped the upper bound on
the number of memory banks that can be added as there was no
technical need in the kernel. It turns out though, some bootloaders
(specifically the arndale-octa exynos boards) may pass invalid memory
information and rely on the kernel to not parse this data. This is a
bug in the bootloader but we still need to work around this.
Re-introduce a maximum bank limit per board to prevent invalid banks
from being passed to the kernel.
