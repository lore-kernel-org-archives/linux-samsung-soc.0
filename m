I understand your concerns here however I didn't want to overengineer
this. Is the same GPIO (on more complex PMICs) used in different
contexts? Like enable control and something more in the same time?

For example the S5M8767 uses different GPIOs for:
1. enable control - one GPIO per regulator,
2. voltage selection (DVS) - 3 GPIOs total,
so there is no benefit in merging this into one common regulator code.

Something like:
 struct regulator_desc desc {
 	.name		= "LDO1
 	.of_match	= of_match_ptr("LDO1"),
 	.regulators_node = of_match_ptr("voltage-regulators"),
 	.ops		= &max77686_ldo_ops,
+	.of_ena_gpio	= of_match_ptr("ena-gpios"),
 ...
 }
?

This is parsed from gpio specifier in DTS: the flags from
include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h.

Thank you for feedback,
