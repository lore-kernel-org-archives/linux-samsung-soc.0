Sure.  This device tree change is needed to get HDMI to work so
it's still a fix for that.  Also it's good to know that nothing
else breaks when the driver issue is "hidden".  Might be worth
testing on -next as well as it might help spot any new issues
that haven't been merged in mainline yet, or in general give
another data point.
