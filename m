The patch was applied so discussion seems useful only for future work. I
don't agree with some of your motivation.

This is new code. You made error in new code... this is not an argument
to change something in existing well tested code.

Nope, the opposite. Usage of devm-like interface hides the order of
cleaning up. With explicit clean it is easy to spot the reverse work of
probe and to find the differences (like when the code is not in the
exact reverse order).

The 'goto' with one exit point is a part of kernel coding style. Of
course lack of error paths is easier to read... usually.

Ekhm? I don't understand.

Usually... but (again) introducing such questionable improvements for
existing code which was well tested and is working fine:
1. May introduce bugs. Code is already working, error path maybe was or
was not tested. At least it was reviewed. Your change may break this.

2. Is unnecessary code churn. If there are no clear benefits (and for me
in case of max77686 there are no benefits) you just used mine and
maintainer's time.


This is even different kind of change than improvements for defensive
coding (like adding 'consts'). Here, the code does not necessarily
improve. Error paths and order of cleanup are hidden.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
