When do you plan to send a pull request for this to Linus?

There are PM domain drivers blocked on entering -next due to this
dependency. As they have to pass through arm-soc first, and the arm-soc
merge window will close soon, time is running out.

Alternatively, you could provide an immutable branch containing this fix
to unblock dependents.

Thanks for your understanding.
