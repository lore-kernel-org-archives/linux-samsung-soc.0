What I said in my message on June 12th applies to this series.  I'm
not having the virtual address exposed via the write_sec call.

Yes, you need to read other registers in order to use your secure
firmware implementation.  Let's fix that by providing a better write_sec
interface so you don't have to read back these registers, rather than
working around this short-coming.

That's exactly what I meant when I talked on June 12th about turning
cache-l2x0.c back into a pile of crap.  You're working around problems
rather than fixing the underlying issue, as seems to be standard
platform maintainer behaviour when things like core ARM code is
concerned.  This is why things devolve over time into piles of crap,
because platforms just hack around problems rather than fixing the
root cause of the problem.

So... I'm NAKing the entire series.
