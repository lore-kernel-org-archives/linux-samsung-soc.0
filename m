This patch series attempts to get rid of soc_is_exynosXXXX macros
and eventually with the help of this series we can probably get
rid of CONFIG_SOC_EXYNOSXXXX in near future.
Each Exynos SoC has ChipID block which can give information about
SoC's product Id and revision number. Currently we have single
DT binding information for this as "samsung,exynos4210-chipid".
But Exynos4 and Exynos5 SoC series have one small difference in
chip Id, with resepect to product id bit-masks. So it means we
should have separate compatible string for these different series
of SoCs. So I have added second compatible string for handling
this difference. 
This patch series is based on Kukjin Kim's for-next (3.14_rc1 tag)
and prepared on top of following patch series and it's dependent
patch series.

[1]: Map SYSRAM through generic SRAM bindings by Sachin Kamat.
	http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg327677.html
[2]: Exynos PMU cleanup and refactoring.
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/30/44
[3]: Introduce drivers/soc and add QCOM GSBI driver.
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/24/520

Revision 2 and it's discussion can be found here
 - https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/6/100

Changes since v2:
 - Reorganized patches as suggested by Tomasz Figa.
 - Addressed review comments of Tomasz Figa in i2c-s3c2410.c file.

Changes since v1:
 - Added patch to move i2c interrupt re-configuration code from exynos.c
   to i2c driver, as suggested by Arnd.
 - After above patch only user of SYS_I2C_CFG register is pm.c so moving
   save/restore of this register also into i2c driver.
 - Spiltted up exynos4 and exynos5 machine descriptors to get rid from
   soc_is_exynos4/exynos5 kind of macros, as suggested by Arnd.
 - Changed location of chipid driver to "drivers/soc".
 - Added drivers/base/soc.c provided infrastructure to make SoC specific 
   information avaible to user space via sysfs entry, as suggested by Arnd.
