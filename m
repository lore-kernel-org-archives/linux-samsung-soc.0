If you want to send up a patch like that I'm happy to give it a once
over and also to test it.  ...but don't feel obligated

On snow locally I see USB2 vbus is gpx1-1 and USB3 vbus is gpx2-7.  I
don't see that in spring.

This will take more time than I have right now to track down.  I added
Julius to the thread in case he has time to answer and can suggest
what to do for upstream purposes.  I may be able to look more
tomorrow.

You can always send up the next version and include this and we'll
look at it again.

Ah, right.  So if we're keeping cros-common the proper thing to do is
to move it out of cros-common in a patch before this one.  ...but I
think people might be happier if you simply don't include cros-common.

I think it's not really supposed to.  It was a bit of a hack to handle
the fact that the RTC has two different i2c addresses on both the
77686 and this PMIC.  The max77686 driver upstream handles it all in
code and doesn't ask the device tree to list both addresses.

I think that _upstream_ snow doesn't have the node but _downstream_
spring might have the node (though having a child of a disabled node
isn't particularly useful).

Yes and it needs to be handled eventually.  It makes suspend/resume
work properly.  ...but I think it needs to be thought out better.

=2E..but given that other users of this PMIC have it I guess it makes
sense to leave it in.  Javier was going to try to think it through
better for max77686 and max77802.

Ah, right.  I forgot about cros5250-common.

It might work, but you run into pinctrl problems.  You need to put the
pinctrl node _somewhere_ and if you put it with the trackpad entries
themselves then you get conflicts.  ...and it doesn't belong in the
i2c bus (though that's what we have locally in our tree)

See <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/30953>
for some background.

Yeah, and it appears to be in linux-next.  (1a395e3 ARM: dts: Use the
cros-ec-keyboard fragment in exynos5250-snow).  It actually ended up
going through the tegra tree since it was in a series with a similar
tegra change.  I asked Kukjin to pick it up via merge but he didn't
appear to.

Generally it's good to have the pinctrl listed to configure the IRQ
properly (get the pulls right).  It might work without it but it's a
little less ideal I think.

I see this, right?

                        pinctrl-names =3D "default";
                        pinctrl-0 =3D <&ec_irq>;

What does "dmesg | grep tps65090" say?

What does this show:
  grep "" /sys/class/regulator/*/name

Yes

Might be due to the cros5250-common.  ...but yes, the battery should
be behind the tunnel too and the patches needed for Spring haven't
been posted by anyone yet.  I picked up a whole bunch of cros_ec
cleanup patches and thought that the tunnel patches for spring could
possible go up after those land.
