look at the device address - not the compatible name:  I'm binding the
'tv' device, made compatible with the sysmmu via Cho KyongHo's "ARM:
dts: Add description of System MMU of Exynos SoCs":

       sysmmu_tv: sysmmu@14650000 {
               compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-sysmmu";
               reg = <0x14650000 0x1000>;
               interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
               interrupts = <7 4>;
               clock-names = "sysmmu";
               clocks = <&clock 349>;
               samsung,power-domain = <&pd_disp1>;
       };

although I don't understand why it's being made compatible with the
sysmmu driver.

I'm using this:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/11/51

to bind.

ok, I thought it was, but I'll double-check, or may try using the MFC.

ok, thanks for the info.

ok, no problem, thanks.
