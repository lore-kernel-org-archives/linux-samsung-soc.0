0) This typo was introduced in commit 0d47acc4ffaa ("ASoC: smdk_wm8994:
Make driver name more unique").

1) So currently there's a difference between platform_drive.driver.name
and the (sub)string used in MODULE_ALIAS(). If I'd understand the
platform_driver interface I might have been able to say whether that
difference is only cosmetic or might actually break stuff. But I don't
understand it so I can't say. I can't even say whether this typo shows
up in some interface to user space.

2) Entirely untested.
