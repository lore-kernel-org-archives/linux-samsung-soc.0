OK, I will make kernel cannot access the memory area with hiding.

Oops, I missed. OK I will add following instead of above.

+/memreserve/ 0x80000000 0x00010000;

If any workarounds are required later, will add specific string then.

Oops, it should be 8.

And yes, as I've mentioned "GH7" is SoC name not CPU name.

I'm still thinking _really_ I need to use CPU specific name for GH7 SoC because
we don't need to handle for the specific CPU implementation in kernel even we
didn't name it.

Definitely, it is meaningful because we can enhance everything more based on
this for the mass product.

Thanks for your time.
