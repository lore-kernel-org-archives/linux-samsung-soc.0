In drivers/mmc/core/host.c, there already is "max-frequency" property.
It's same functionality with "clock-freq-min-max". 
Minimum clock value can be fixed to 100K. because MMC core will check clock value from 400K to 100K.
But max-frequency can be difference.
If we can use "max-frequency" property, we don't need to use "clock-freq-min-max" property anymore.
I will resend the deprecated property instead of removing "clock-freq-min-max".

If you want to pick this, it's possible to pick. Then i will resend the patches without dt patches.
