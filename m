Changes in v2:
	-Added some acks.
	-Updated commit messages.
	-Included a wider audience of the patchset. V1 was lacking SoC
	 maintainers.

Here are link to the first patchset, were some discussion started.

When there are more than one device in a PM domain these will obviously
be probed at different times. Depending on timing and the implemented
support for runtime PM in a driver/subsystem, genpd may be advised to
power off a PM domain after a successful probe sequence.

Ideally we should have relied on the driver/subsystem, through runtime
PM, to bring their device's PM domain into powered state prior doing
probing if such requirement exist.

Since this is not a common practice by drivers/subsystems, enforcing
such a change doesn't seem viable.

Instead, let's improve the situation, by preventing genpd from powering
off any of the PM domains until late_init. At that point genpd already
tries to power off unused PM domains, so it seems like a decent match.

Cases which can't be covered within the window of until late_init needs
to be adressed separately and likely through a more common long term
solution.


Ulf Hansson (4):
  PM / Domains: Remove pm_genpd_dev_need_restore() API
  ARM: exynos: Ensure PM domains are powered at initialization
  PM / Domains: Expect PM domains being powered at initialization
  PM / Domains: Enforce PM domains to stay powered during boot
