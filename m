Yeah, but this actually does not entirely cover my doubts. We cannot
enable everything built-in because boot partitions on some devices have
limited size. So enabling everything would break that use case (use case
of easy testing).

Let me rephrase my question into:
1. What is worth enabling in exynos_defconfig? USB devices? I would
argue, except they are needed to boot.
So maybe enable everything which Exynos boards have hard-wired? That
would make some sense... but we're making kernel larger.

2. Maybe enable only what is a typical use case (including typical
testing cases)? Then we would have to define what "typical" means. For
example battery would be typical but camera would not.

3. Argh, so maybe, if we agree that not everything is worth being
enabled, that additional stuff could be build as module?

I don't argue about switching from "y" to "m". That's not the case.
Rather I am thinking where/when we should stop enabling stuff?
