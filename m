"[PATCH v4] Samsung: add new card detection methods in s3c-sdhci driver
(platform part)" perform some important changes in platform setup code.
It does not influence the driver itself (the driver can be still compiled
as before and works without changes).

The only changes added by Kukjin Kim were compilation fixes (looks I've
forgot one include on the platform that has not been tested). 

This patch is also a prerequisite for "[PATCH v4] sdhci-s3c: add support
for new card detection methods (driver part)".

I would to ask not for dropping. As all required platform changes has been
already merged by Kukjin, s
dhci-s3c-add-support-for-the-non-standard-minimal-clock-value.patch and 
sdhci-s3c-add-support-for-new-card-detection-methods-driver-part.patch can
be merged without causing compilation break in the 'next' kernel tree.
