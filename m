Regardless, your description should say what is really happening.  The
master device doesn't power-manage the clock; some driver power-manages
it.

forbid/allow blocks/unblocks runtime PM according to the user's 
requirements, not the driver's requirements.

The purpose doesn't matter.  If no_callbacks does what you want then 
you should use it instead of adding another API.
