Hi Tomasz Figa,

Some mass product projects using Exynos5250 and etc, use s3c-fb driver
and dp driver. Also, these projects are still using Framebuffer, not DRM.

However, when considering only mainline kernel, I have no strong objection.
As you know, many Linux kernel based OS projects using Exynos, are using
DRM, not Framebuffer.

Also, if moving DP driver to DRM, MAINTAINERS entry for Exynos DP driver
should be updated, too.
