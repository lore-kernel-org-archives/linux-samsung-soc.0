Building only one ARM config may be sufficient for trivial changes but
for more complex stuff (especially when dealing with Kconfig) needs more
build coverage. 

On Ubuntu you can easily cross compile for x86, x86_64,
arm, arm64 and powerpc. You can also use this cross-compiler collection:

OK, sounds good for me. Thanks for explanation.
