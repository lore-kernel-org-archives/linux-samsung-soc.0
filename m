Well, noise or not, Exynos is still broken in mainline and was broken
on -next for so long in different ways that bisecting it is a futile
exercise in frustration.

It doesn't seem to show up with a trivial boot using only ramdisk, but
when booting a real distro from disk, it certainly does.

For example:

http://arm-soc.lixom.net/bootlogs/mainline/v4.1-rc1-56-g3d99e3f/pi-arm-exynos_defconfig.html

Disabling CONFIG_DRM makes it boot reliably.

Arndale doesn't show it for me, but it also doesn't have working graphics.
