Only to cause an exit of the VM, and not under the control of the host.
This isn't triggering any timer related action on the host code either.

Your patch series seems to assume some kind of predictability of the
timer interrupt, which can make sense on the host. Here, this interrupt
is shared among *all* guests running on this system.

Maybe you could explain why you think this interrupt is relevant to what
you're trying to achieve?

Thanks,
