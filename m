Indeed... Status has value 0x3 which means that buffer is not full,
seed setup is done and PRNG engine is idle. I tried this also on
Trats2 board (Exynos 4412) with exactly the same result. No idea.

It's okay. Accepted values for engine are only from 0 to 5. The bit no
4 (start init bit) is automatically cleared by hardware.
