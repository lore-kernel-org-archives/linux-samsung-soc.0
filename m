My comment was not about the need to have reference counting, as this is 
a common design pattern, but rather that there should be a low level 
power control function, which simply disables the IOMMU, without the 
need to loop through existing references.

Actually there is already such function - __sysmmu_disable_nocount() - 
so the code could look like:

	list_for_each_entry_safe(owner, n, &priv->clients, client) {
		__sysmmu_disable_nocount(owner->dev);
		list_del_init(&owner->client);
	}

As for reference counting in this use case in general, as far as I'm 
looking through the whole driver code, there is no other usage of this 
reference counting than exynos_iommu_attach_device() and 
exynos_iommu_detach_device(). Assuming that there is just a single 
master for each SYSMMU, I don't see why reference counting is even 
needed, as you can't bind a device to IOMMU multiple times.

Huh? I'm not sure what kind of comment is this.

No. Proper Linux drivers must support deferred probing mechanism and 
there should be no assumptions about probing orders. Using other 
initcall level than module_initcall for particular drivers is strongly 
discouraged.

Yes. It is a serious issue from code readability point of view, as you 
don't know what kind of object pointed by this pointer to expect when 
reading the driver.

Keep in mind that readability is one of the key factors affecting driver 
maintainability which is important if the driver is intended to be kept 
in mainline for many Linux kernel releases, adding support for new 
hardware variants and keeping the driver in good shape over future 
kernel changes (e.g. large refactors of upper layers, such as IOMMU 
subsystem).

OK. If this is just a temporary step, then I guess we can ignore this 
issue. I just noted that such usage is a problem in general.
