Hello,

I've applied the patchset to 4.5-rc4 and I'm now encountering two
additional problems. The first related to debugfs entries, the second
cocerning RCU locking.

Here are the debugfs lines:
exynos-bus bus_dmc: device_opp_debug_create_link: Failed to create link
exynos-bus bus_dmc: _add_list_dev: Failed to register opp debugfs (-12)
exynos-bus bus_dmc: Looking up vdd-supply from device tree
exynos-bus: new bus device registered: bus_dmc (100000 KHz ~ 400000 KHz)
exynos-bus bus_acp: device_opp_debug_create_link: Failed to create link
exynos-bus bus_acp: _add_list_dev: Failed to register opp debugfs (-12)
exynos-bus: new bus device registered: bus_acp (100000 KHz ~ 267000 KHz)
exynos-bus bus_c2c: device_opp_debug_create_link: Failed to create link
exynos-bus bus_c2c: _add_list_dev: Failed to register opp debugfs (-12)
exynos-bus: new bus device registered: bus_c2c (100000 KHz ~ 400000 KHz)
exynos-bus bus_leftbus: device_opp_debug_create_link: Failed to create link
devfreq bus_dmc: Couldn't update frequency transition information.
exynos-bus bus_leftbus: _add_list_dev: Failed to register opp debugfs (-12)
exynos-bus bus_leftbus: Looking up vdd-supply from device tree


The RCU output is a bit longer, so I attached it.


With best wishes,
Tobias
