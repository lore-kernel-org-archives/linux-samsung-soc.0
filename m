Right. Once lockdep complains lockdep turns itself off, so we
lose the ability to detect other problems. Even if it's a false
positive, it's a potential problem on some device so it's
concerning that runtime PM usage from clk framework has created
this potential problem.

Is it possible to remove the clk operations from the exynos power
domains? You say it's to deal with the lack of rate/topology
restoration so maybe it can be changed. That will at least allow
lockdep to continue working here and detect the "real" deadlock
here. Otherwise, do we need to revert runtime PM for clk
framework and back out all the Samsung changes on top of that? If
we need to do that, we need to do it soon.

We'll need to think about how to resolve the cross-subsystem
locking problem regardless. We definitely want to have genpd be
able to do CCF things, and CCF to use runtime PM and genpds too.
It seems that we have a classic AB-BA deadlock potential between
the clk prepare lock and the genpd domain mutex. Both frameworks
are holding a mutex across the operations of their providers
(either clk_ops or genpd power_on/off) so we can't have the CCF
call genpd things and genpd call CCF things or lockdep will
complain.  I was worried about runtime PM usage by CCF causing
this problem, but I missed that genpd was behind runtime PM so I
didn't consider the locks in that part of the chain. Ugh.

Maybe we can have runtime PM things done outside of the prepare
lock in CCF, that way we aren't holding any locks that genpd may
need to use. That would fix the problem, but would expose us to
clk tree topology changes happening while we enable runtime PM
for clks. It would be great if we could drop all framework level
locks when we call into provider drivers. I'm not sure how to do
that yet, but that's probably the end goal.

Anyway, this needs some thought to figure out how to redesign the
CCF locking scheme so this problem doesn't exist.
