Right, so - we're now at -rc1, and we should see about queuing this up
sooner rather than later - in its fixed form.  From what I can see,
there's been little progress on the OMAP problem.

Nishanth - can we push OMAP over to using the generic DT L2C
initialisation (the one from init_IRQ in arch/arm/kernel/irq.c) and
kill the SoC specific stuff in arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap4-common.c ?

>From what I can see, in the DT case, the only thing which is used
there is the ioremap() to provide omap4_get_l2cache_base() with
something to return.  Everything else - the initialisation of the
l2c_write_sec pointer, and the aux mask and values - can be specified
via the machine_desc struct.

That only leaves the non-DT stuff to worry about this, and from what I
understand, that's going to be removed soon.  If we're going to keep
the non-DT stuff, we should implement a new machine_desc hook for it
instead of hijacking one of the existing callbacks.
