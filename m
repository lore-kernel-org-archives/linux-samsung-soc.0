I don't have great plan, just wanted to share my thoughts around the
problems we want to solve.

To give a good answer of these questions, I need to spend more time
investigating.

However, from a top-level point of view, I think the device links
seems like the perfect match for solving the runtime/system PM
problems.

No matter whether we can set up the links at device initialization
time, driver probe or whatever time.

Agree, let's drop the deferred probe topic from the discussions - it's
just going to be overwhelming. :-)

Okay.

Okay.

Kind regards
