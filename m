I agree this active error handling. 
But, existing fifo_reset function is focused on fifo reset purely.
I think your change is close to error recovery and it seems overloaded to basic function.
So, you suggest renaming function for new sequence.
And look into dw_mci_work_routine_card(). dw_mci_idmac_reset() is redundancy.
I expect it can be cleaned.

Please remove this section number.
No needed. It's old version.

"DW-DMA" means Synopsys's DMA controller not IDMAC.
SDMMC_CTRL_DMA_RESET can apply in all type DMA interface.

When I tried ciu_reset, I found some unexpected interrupts occurred.
It means that interrupt handler will run to handle extra interrupts.
Then, we may need mask the interrupt.
Can you check it for test?

In case of ctrl_reset, waiting is during 2 clock.
If this polling status is not long, I'm OK.

Yes.
But at least if ciu_reset is done successfully, it may need clock update sequence again.
In addition, printing reset bit[2:0] will be helpful for debug information.
