First of all, I agree this approach absolutely.

Almost clock domains are enough to support the runtime PM with this approach.
But, the specific clock domain should be handled by CLK_OF_DECLARE
if the specific clock domain contains the clocks for timer.
Because some clocks for timer are required on early boot phase.

Maybe, Need to find the further method to support the runtime PM for
all clock domains.
