pre-EXYNOS SoC do not support device tree, but I had to enable flat device
tree support to get them working once in the past and I still have it in my
config. Now I see that kernel boots fine without enabling flat device tree,
but imho the reported issue should be fixed to reduce the amount of work in
the future.
