Urgh. I fail to understand this comment.

Why do we prefer the pm_runtime_get_sync() solution in favour of this
pathset's approach?

What are the benefit do we get with pm_runtime_get_sync()?

Yes, I want this error handling - but I fail to understand why the bus
can't handle the errors.

If works perfectly in this patchset's approach.

What ordering problems?

And how exactly will you then power up the PM domain when
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is unset?

I working on fully understanding your idea. :-)
