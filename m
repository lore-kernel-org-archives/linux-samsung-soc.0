The pin is WL_REG_ON so your configuration is correct. Although other
DTSes add usually a power sequence which forces a hard-reset before
initialization of device. If it works fine like this, then I am okay
with it.

Having vmmc and vqmmc at 1.8V should be possible, for example all
other Exynos54xx Odroids use such configuration (although for eMMC).
However you mentioned that the card asks for different voltage?

This is probably non-pluggable card so adding simple brcm node would
be good for full description of device... although it is not
necessary, I think. The node might be needed to specify waking up
interrupts (WL_DEV_WAKE which probably is GPX3-2. See the
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wireless/brcm,bcm43xx-fmac.txt
and example in: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mmc/mmc.txt
