I agree, but I think it should be 
setup->enable->video_on->video_off->disable->setup->...
I don't think there is any interface parameters that should be changed 
while link is enabled. And if there are, they should be identified and 
split out into a separate operation.

We have similar use cases and so I agree (and have implemented) the 
latter approach where panel driver is in control. I think it is 
important to separate the panel calling dispc (which it should not) from 
panel calling bus/videosource ops. Compare to I2C, no one would expect 
panel to call dispc to do I2C ops, instead panel call bus ops directly 
in response to the CDF ops request panel is running.

Do you reroute after boot? Or is this just "board/product setup". We 
have some pinmuxing as well and DPhy sharing, but we have never used it 
after init/boot. If not runtime, I think this could be put in DT config 
for product instead of under dynamic control from panel.
