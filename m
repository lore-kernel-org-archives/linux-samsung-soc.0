The warnings themself are indeed about purity.... but not having
warnings is quite useful. When you have already warnings either in C
code or in DTC, it is quite easy to skip new ones.

We successfully get rid of all DTC warnings from ARM part. It would be
nice to have the same for ARM64... but not with a cost of making bogus
changes.

Good point so this patch should come along with changing of bindings
(and maybe the code as well to use -1 as port/reg).

I keep my fingers crossed for this :)
