Not really. As long as you have dwc3 core as a separate device, you can 
add a node for it.
Just that the glue should create a device for dwc3 core using 
of_platform_populate.(You can have a look at 
drivers/usb/dwc3/dwc3-omap.c in usb-next)

No. We have added usb_get_phy_dev() for that purpose in the case of non-dt.
I think, instead you can have a patch to use devm_usb_get_phy_dev() here 
and in exynos platform specific code use usb_bind_phy() to bind the phy 
and controller till you change it to dt.

NAK.
