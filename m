During a normal power gating sequence, this problem is not seen
But Once the suspend-resume cycle is done,  if we try to turn on or
turn off domain,
this issue occurs.

I agree that CLKSRC register should be saved
before the power domain register is programmed.

Saving of CLKSRC_TOP3 register is already being done in clock driver
code.i.e in exynos5_clock_save[]. But the problem remains. So i feel
an exclusive saving of the register in pm_domain driver is required.

Kindly let me know your opinion

Yes , we can look into this, once the clock migration happens for Exynos5
Until then, can it be used as statically io-remapped ?

Yes, of_machine_is_compatible function will be used
instead of soc_is_exynos5250()
