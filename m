You know, it is only a defconfig. The issue is there regardless of
change in defconfig. I am not convinced that defconfig problems are
worth backporting. multi_v7 has it enabled anyway.

Maybe the EXYNOS_DRM should have some anti-dependency on SIMPLE_FB? But
on the other hand the issue is actually caused by hacks in bootloader...
