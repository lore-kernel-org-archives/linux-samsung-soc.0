sure,  we will add comment  to sort the table in descending order.

Actually this table should contain the recommended values
and if we see the user manual, the input(parent) rate is also a part
of recommended
table of different output rate for a particular PLL for that SoC.

So as Tomasz said input(parent) rate may change with board,
then, do those corresponding recommended p, m, s, k will be valid?

In case, input(parent) rate changes then we may need different set of p, m ,s, k
values recommended for new input rate to get required(recommended to
use) output rate.

So, we think its better that the p, m, s and k along with the parent
is known at the compile time ( or DT ?),
as these p, m, s, k values are very much coupled with the parent rate
to achieve the
 required(recommended to use) output rate.

Also, since the sorted table is required (sorted based on "rate"),
its better to have the rate in a const rate table.

And the whole set of recommended values should come from same place(DT
or static table),
to keep the things simple and consistent.

Moreover, practically for a particular SoC , we use the recommended
input(parent) rate only for a PLL.
So we should keep the things simple here presently.

No, as these values should be the recommended values to be written in
corresponding  register bits. So it should remain unsigned.

K value should be considered as negative only while recalculating rate.

As per exynos5250 user manual's section 7.3.2 :
" K value description "Postive value (Negative value)":
Postive values is that you should write EPLLCON/VPLLCON register.
Negative value is that you can calculate PLL output frequency with it."
