Yeah, you lucky guys with the GO bit ;). No, we actually do CPU 
stop,setup,start. But since it is video mode, master is driving the sync 
so it is not a hard deadline. It is enough to restart before pixels 
start to degrade. On an LCD that is not so much time, but on an OLED it 
could be 10 secs :). Anyway, we have had several mass products with this 
soft solution and it has worked well.

I understand, but removing the omap prefix doesn't mean it has to go in 
the panel slave port/bus settings. I still can't see why this should be 
configuration on the panel driver and not the DSI master driver. Number 
of pins might be useful since you might start with one lane and then 
activate the rest. But partial muxing (pre pinmux) doesn't seem to be 
something the panel should control or know anything about. Sounds like 
normal platform/DT data per product/board.
