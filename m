It is a huge step forward - to be honest it is a serious rework of
cpufreq subsystem for Exynos SoCs.

Since we have missed the merge window with this code, I can declare
that I will provide code, which means that I will do the cleanup for
excluded from this series Exynos4 SoCs, to test the cpufreq-cpu0.

However, I'm concerned with Exynos4412, which supports BOOST. It might
not be trivial to provide support for it.

I think, that we shall not drop behind any functionality during clean
up.
