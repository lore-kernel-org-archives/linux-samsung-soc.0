Subject: [PATCH v2 1/2] i2c: s3c2410: Print errno code in error logs

The driver not always prints the error code in case of a failure but this
information can be very useful for debugging. So let's print if available.

Hello,

This patch and 2/2 were only build tested because I don't have access to
a board using this IP block. I just noticed these issues when comparing
the i2c-s3c2410 driver with i2c-exynos5 where I did some fixes recently.

I think the patches are simple enough that is safe to pick them but of
course testing will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,
Javier

Changes in v2:
- Don't print the errno code on probe since it's already printed by the
  core. Suggested by Krzysztof Kozlowski.
