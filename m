Won't you have to push down all the references to VA_SYSRAM vs
VA_SYSRAM_NS into the firmware interface anyway, since you will need
to use different addresses for whether you have firmware enabled or
not? I.e. you'll have a "firmware call" at the appropriate level for
the non-trustzone cases that uses the equivalent of VA_SYSRAM, and for
the trustzone firmware op you'll use VA_SYSRAM_NS?

I'm not quite sure which part you are asking me to merge, if it's the
infrastructure pieces or the exynos-specific pieces.

Either way, one isn't really usable without the other, and it doesn't
make sense to merge code that can't be used. Infrastructure is best
merged together with the first user of it.
