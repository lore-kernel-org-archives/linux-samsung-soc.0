Hi Mr. Kukjin.

I know that use only S3C64XX_ or S3C24XX.
But i think no problem that change to S3C_SDHCI_xxx form S3C64XX_SDHCI_=
xxx.
Because now that's meaningless...Though use the S3C64XX_SDHCI_xxx or S3=
C24xxx_,
finally that also use in sdhci-s3c.c.

What means that distinguish between S3C_SDHCI and S3C64xx_SDHCI?

Best Regards,
Jaehoon Chung
