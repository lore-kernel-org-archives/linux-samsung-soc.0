Samsung S5PV210 and Exynos SoC has a separate subsystem for audio. This subsystem
has a internal clock controller which controls i2s0 and pcm0 clocks. This patch
series adds the Samsung audio subsytem clock to the common clock framework and
provides the I2S controllers clock information in the dtsi file.

This patch series is made based on Kukjin Kim for-next branch

Changes since V3:
	- Replaced samsung with exynos in the macro prefixes and function names
	  as this driver supports mainly exynos and s5p family.
	- Added Reviewed-by:Sylwester Nawrocki <s.nawrocki@samsung.com>

Changes since V2:
        - Removed s5pv210 compatible name from driver as it is
          not yet supported which is different from Exynos series
          audio subsystem clock conroller.
        - Removed clkdev lookup support and added alias names in
          the i2s0 controller node.
Changes since V1:
        - Reworked on all review comments by Sylwester Nawrocki
        - Added a header file for all clock indexes as requested by Sylwester
        - Added different compatible names for s5pv210, exynos4 and exynos5
        - Registered the pcm clocks with common clock framework

Padmavathi Venna (4):
  ARM: samsung: use #include for all device trees
  clk: samsung: register audio subsystem clocks using common clock
    framework
  ARM: dts: add Exynos audio subsystem clock controller node
  ARM: dts: add clock provider information for i2s controllers in
    Exynos5250
