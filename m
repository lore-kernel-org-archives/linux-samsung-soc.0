In general, yes. Unless there's a compelling reason to drop a binding,
and all users are happy with it being dropped, then there's not much
point in removing it. It's usually not possible to get agreement because
it's usually nto possible to know the full set of users, so in general
we can't drop or change stuff.

Deprecated bindings can be supported even if discouraged. As far as I
can see, keeping the existing binding along side the new one looks
relatively simple in this case.

Thanks,
Mark.
