A couple of things to point out here:

1. The User r/w thread and process ID is not saved/restored by Linux over
context switches, so it doesn't serve any useful purpose to save and
restore over resume.

2. Compare the instruction saving and restoring the vector base address
(see below for the restore code.)

Which means it's pointless saving and restoring that register, because
we already aren't restoring it (plus there's the possibility that if we
were to write to it, we'd get an abort.)
