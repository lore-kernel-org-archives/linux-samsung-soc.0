What's the local_irq_save() there for?

Presumably it is for local-cpu-only protection of some data.  But which
data is it there to protect?

It doesn't provide protection on SMP systems and if I'm guessing
correctly about why it was added, it would be much better to use
spin_lock_irq[save]() here.  That sets a better example, it means the
code has a hope of working correctly on SMP systems and will devolve to
local_irq_save() on UP kernels anyway.
