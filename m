MMC layer anticipates the favorable requests for packing from I/O sched=
uler.
Obviously request order from I/O scheduler might be poor for packing an=
d requests can't be packed.
But that doesn't mean mmc layer need to wait a better pack-case.
BLKPREP_DEFER may give rise to I/O latency. Top of request will be defe=
rred next time.=20
If request can't be packed, it'd rather be sent at once than delayed
by returning a BLKPREP_DEFER for better responsiveness.
