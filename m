Did you change the address-cells to <1>?

Yes, I still want separate properties because this too generic. In next
SoC they will extend the register and you will have to extend the
binding. I agree for simplicity reasons to group timings in an array.
But not entire register.

Actually 15 secs of search by grep revealed that they are already
documented and published. I looked at first image coming into my mind:
GT-I9300_JB
arch/arm/mach-exynos/include/mach/sromc-exynos4.h

Actually no... I don't know why...
All of us are using whatever we want (mutt+MDA, thunderbird, kmail,
etc.). At least in two locations I've been: in Polish R&D and in HQ.
