After putting it under common exynos54xx you would have to anyway
override/extend most of the nodes so I think there is no much sense for
that. Instead it should be in exynos5410.dtsi and exynos5422.dtsi.

You mean exynos5420-cpus.dtsi, not board DTS?

For exynos542x/5800 you could indeed add it directly to
exynos542x-cpus.dtsi, following existing pattern about cpus (with
comment).
