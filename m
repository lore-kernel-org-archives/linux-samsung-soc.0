OK.

OK. Will update this description as suggested.

I do not have strong objections to change this, but I can see doing so
will increase two or three lines in driver, as such this property is not
being used as bool in driver.


Sorry to say this but I do not understand why these comments are coming
now? Whereas you had given your "Acked-by" to the same patch when it was
posted previously by Pavel and we were keeping this driver under
"drivers/soc/samsung". Is it just because we are moving to
"drivers/memory" and it needs to be consistent with other memory
controller drivers?

Thanks,
