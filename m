And in this probe parse all pd device nodes and populate all related information from those nodes into Exynos_pm_domain struct instances and keep list of these instances. Same has been proposed in Amit's patch.

Please check this [2], [3].

I will post this sleep driver shortly. I also suggest to keep
everything in drivers/soc/samsung as all these drivers very much SoC
specific.

> As Lee mentioned MFD can be used to register the device ( I am assuming he is referring to use of " mfd_add_devices" from Exynos -PMU driver, to make it a mfd device) but it should be kept outside of "drivers/mfd". I just looked for current users of "mfd_add_devices" but only drivers from "drivers/mfd" only are calling this API, also once we call this API it will become an MFD device then why not keep into "drivers/mfd" or maybe I have little understanding of purpose of "drivers/mfd".

As "drivers/power" looks like place to keep external power supply drivers such as batteries, AC, USB etc.
