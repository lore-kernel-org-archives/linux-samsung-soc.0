I think we're talking at cross purposes here - I'm saying that this
whole situation is disappointing, not a specific decision.

This is pretty much what I'm saying is disappointing - in this case the
whole fact that we're not managing to get stuff actually merged.  It's
very frustrating that we're ending up in a situation where getting
things applied to the maintainer's tree and into -next (which is usually
the end of what you need to do as a patch submitter) isn't enough to
actually get the changes pushed upstream.

Yeah, me included.  Like I said I'd probably have sent a fix if I'd been
able to figure out what the changes the error referred to were.

So, is there anything that people like me who are contributing to rather
than maintaining things can do to help here beyond chasing maintainers?

Generally my process is roughly to monitor what goes into -next and
chase people if things don't make it in there but that's not working
well here as things are appearing in -next.
