Well, IMHO, SoC is just SoC and we don't think each CPU(core) from SoC and I'm
still wondering why the specific compatible string for CPU is needed in kernel.
And I don't see any custom handling for GH7 SoC. Note sorry, I don't get about
implementation-defined registers.

Could you please let me know what was the problem?
If it could be on exynos, would be helpful to me.

I mean, we need to use current GIC implementation for GH7 SoC at this moment.

SoC. Similar as above. AFAIK, ARM SoC vendors usually didn't name for each CPU
not SoC if there is no change in core hardware implementation, at least Samsung
didn't name.

OK, if you still have strong objection on this, I will remove PMU support here
until agreement about that.

Actually, some firmware handles them and basically and kernel doesn't need.

At the end, we are going to use just upstream kernel for GH7 without any HACKs
but as a preliminary, this is a good start point even there is HACK for a while.
