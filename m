It should be as simple as setting few more registers in SSS module
(actually maybe just enabling TRNG_SEED_START in PRNG). You do not
have to model it in a kernel like connecting some hw_rng entity to
cryptoai's rng_alg. See the jitterentropy-kcapi.c. I understand that
in that case existing exynos-rng.c could expose two different RNG
devices - one PRNG based on user's seed and second TRNG (actually
TRNG+PRNG).

It does not seem difficult to model but the question is whether that
makes sense.

Indeed this gives more flexibility to the user (choice of engine) but
first, it is slower, and second it reduces the quality of random
numbers (PRNG reseeds itself... but in this model cannot reseed from
TRNG).
