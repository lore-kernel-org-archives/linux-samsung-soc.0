I guess it depends on what's being done during the reboot sequence.

The most proper thing would be to let the boot loader control the GPIO
to trigger the HW reset, but that would mean the boot loader need to
know about board specific configurations, such as which GPIO pin. So
maybe SOC vendors need to state what GPIO pin to use and don't leave
that as a configurable option.

>From kernel perspective, the best we can do is to the GPIO, when doing
a controlled reset (soft reset, or whatever we call it), but I am not
sure where that should be done? Is there a guarantee that the mmc bus'
->shutdown() callback gets called in this sequence?

Moreover, adding the reset GPIO as part of the initialization
procedure in the mmc core, gives us other benefits and it won't hurt.
So no matter, I think it's worth to proceed and discuss Marek's
proposal.

Kind regards
