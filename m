That's a reasonable point.  It's not clear to me whether the
recommended PMSK values would be the same or different if the input
wasn't 24MHz.  You're assuming that they would be different and that
seems fair given my (limited) understanding of the electrical
characteristics of PLLs.

...so if a given SoC needed to support multiple different parent clock
frequencies the presumably it would have multiple tables and pick the
right one to pass in.

Having the rate in the table definitely makes it easier to understand,
too.  We just have to hope someone doesn't mess up in their
calculation.  Worst case we could put some error checking somewhere.

You _could_ still sort the table based on eventually rate even if the
actual rate wasn't in the table.  ...but I agree that it's harder to
look at and figure out.

Agree that it's a little weird now that some bits of the clock code is
in the device tree and some bits are just static tables in code.
...but I think that's OK for now.

Perhaps a reasonable compromise is to include "24mhz" in the name of
the tables (in later patches) and then give a WARN_ON if the xxti
clock isn't 24MHz.  Then you've effectively documented the plan of
action should someone eventually need a different xxti clock.

new user manual in the future that provides instructions for using a
non-24MHz xxti clock.  ...but with all of the above I think we've got
a reasonable story so I think we're good.

OK, fair point.  We can keep it unsigned in this table.


To summarize where I think we are in this series, I'm hoping for one
more version that:
* Adds a comment about the rate table being sorted (and which direction)
* Adds "24mhz" to the variable name for the PLL tables in future patch series
* Adds a WARN_ON if the xxti clock isn't 24MHz


Does that sound like a plan?  Tomasz: any thoughts on the above?
