IMHO this will be the cleanest way. Thanks for the idea.

Video codec has only standard 2 resources - ioregs and irq, so there
is not much left for such splitting.

Ok. Today while iterating over the hardware requirements I noticed
one more thing. Our codec hardware has one more, odd requirement for
video buffers. The DMA addresses need to be aligned to 8KiB or 16KiB
(depending on buffer type). Do you have any idea how this can be
handled in a generic way?
