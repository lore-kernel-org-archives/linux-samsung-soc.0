The patch was not patchwork compatible:
    Applying patch #10587863 using 'git am -s'
    Description: mini2440 MMC correct write protect detection
    Applying: mini2440 MMC correct write protect detection
    error: arm/mach-s3c24xx/mach-mini2440.c: does not exist in index

git-am by default expects -p1.

The preferred and easiest way to generate patches is to use git for your
work and then just:
    $ git format-patch -1
    $ scripts/get_maintainer 000*
    $ git send-email --to ........  000*

(the last commands can be even squashed into one but that is just
optimization).

If you do not use git, please pay attention to generate proper
applicable patches.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
