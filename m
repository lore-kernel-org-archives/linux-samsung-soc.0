Hi,

Patchset adds necessary clocks, reorganizes existing stuff and finally
adds Odroid XU support.


Changes since v2
================
1. Got global-ack from Stephen for the clock changes. I think merging
   everything through arm-soc might be the easiest but:
   a. In such case I will prepare a tag with clock changes,
   b. Anyway I will wait for response from Sylwester and Tomasz.
2. Applied comments from Javier and added his Reviewed-by.
3. Patch 22: added ack from Rob.
4. Minor improvements in existing patches.
5. Five new patches at the end: 23-27 (not reviewed yet).
   Some of them could be squashed with existing ones but existing
   changes got reviews. Although the final Odroid XU DTS works fine but
   in general this is still work-in-progress so I suspect it will grow.
   I am releasing it early following Linux concept. :)

Patchset is available at my private repo @github:
https://github.com/krzk/linux.git for-next/odroid-xu-v3

(previous version is in for-next/odroid-xu-v2 branch, if someone would
like to compare them)


Changes since v1
================
1. A lot of new patches.
2. Removed some TODO notes (eMMC 4.5 so no RCLK pin).
3. New clocks, more reorganization.
4. New common DTSI: exynos54xx.dtsi. I know, it is getting more
   and more complicated but this might help removing duplications
   and keeping everything under control.



Merging strategy
================
Complicated! The clock dt-bindings and driver changes can go to clock
tree. However there are three DTS patches in the middle.
a. This has to go in before adding "fin_pll_new" to clock driver:
   - [PATCH v2 03/22] ARM: dts: exynos: Add fin_pll node for clock driver

b. This should go in before renaming "fin_pll_new" back to original name:
   - [PATCH v2 05/22] ARM: dts: exynos: Switch MCT node to a new fin_pll clock
   - [PATCH v2 06/22] ARM: dts: exynos: Remove old fixed-clock provider on SMDK5410

The order of patches in the patchset is really how it should go in
to reduce any bisectability glitches.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
