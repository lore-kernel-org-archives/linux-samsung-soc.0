Damn, the mismatch in names is confusing. The vendor sets WUDR which
on S2MPS15 is bit 1.

You are setting bit 1 (okay) and bit 4. This is different which makes
me asking questions.

Okay, I will take a look when I get to the office tomorrow.

Anyway setting alarm above is strange. You are setting bit 4 twice. One as:
  data |= info->regs->rtc_udr_mask;
and then:
  case S2MPS15X:
    data |= S2MPS15_RTC_AUDR_MASK;

Yeah, I know this is misleading. Could you document expected behavior
exactly somewhere in the code or in the commit message? "bit fields
are changed for WUDR and AUDR." seems not enough. Instead I would be
happy to see a statement: "to set time registers, AUDR and WUDR must
be set, to set alarm ....  etc. where AUDR and WUDR on S2MPS15 are
reversed"

Best regards,
Krzysztof
