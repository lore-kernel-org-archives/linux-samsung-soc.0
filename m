There was some previous discussion in this list about what's the best
approach to handle common DTS chunks, please take a look to
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/362633/.

In summary, there is a common .dtsi file for Daisy based boards
(arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5250-cros-common.dtsi) but it seems it turned
out to do more harm than good since having a single .dtsi for all the
common DTS chunks is not quite flexible. As more boards gets
introduced you have to start moving stuff from the common .dtsi file
to the board .dts.

The same was tried to do for OMAP2+ boards and it turned out that you
need to either a) create a hierarchy of .dtsi files to model all the
different board combinations that have similar fragments or b) split
out isolated DTS fragments on an .dtsi and include a set of this
fragments.

 For an example of a) you can take a look to
arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-overo* and for b) to
arch/arm/boot/dts/omap-gpmc-smsc9*.dtsi.

For a Peach Pit/Pi specific example of b) you can look at the recent
arch/arm/boot/dts/cros-ec-keyboard.dtsi file that Doug added for Peach
Pit/Pi keyboard.

Personally I think that b) is a more flexible and reusable approach.
So, maybe instead of creating a cros-exynos-peach.dts to contain all
the common DT nodes you can add a cros-ec-thermistor.dsti file that
only includes the ADC based Thermistor nodes?

Thanks a lot and best regards,
Javier
