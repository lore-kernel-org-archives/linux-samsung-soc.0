Hi Sachin, Andrew,

Hmm, I have tested the driver with a PWM-driven backlight and have not
observed any flickering, but you are right, a sudden manual update could
cause an instant transition of the TOUTn pin from 1 to 0, depending on
time of reconfiguration, so it's not a good behavior.

Please see my further comments inline, though.

Hmm, how is it possible to have a bigger value in TCNTO than in TCNTB?
When you start a timer the first time, you load it manually with a value
from TCNTB. Then, subsequent overflows (underflows?) will cause it to
reload the value of TCNTB automatically. So the value can be at most
equal to TCNTB.

Same for the autoreload bit. This driver allows only continuous operation
of the channel, where autoreload bit is always set, if the channel is
under operation.

In general, I believe that it would be enough to simply skip the manual
update when the channel is already running, by simply removing the call
to pwm_samsung_enable() from pwm_samsung_config(). I really can't
remember why I added it.

In fact, the most appropriate solution would be to stop the channel, write
new TCTNB and TCMPB values and restart it from where it stopped, as this
is the only method to assure that both TCTNB and TCMPB are loaded to TCNT
and TCMP atomically on next reload.

Best regards,
Tomasz
