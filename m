Hi all,

This v2 patch set aims to address the issue with devfreq devices' frequency
during suspend/resume. It extends suspend/resume by calls to Devfreq
framework. In the devfreq framework there is a small refactoring to avoid
code duplication in changging frequency (patch 1) and there are extensions
for suspending devices. The suspending device has now chance to set proper
state when the system is going for suspend. This phase is the right place
to set needed frequences for the next resume process.

It has been tested on Odroid u3 with Exynos 4412.

The patch set draws on Tobias Jakobi's work posted ~2 years ago, who tried
to solve issue with devfreq device's frequency during suspend/resume.
During the discussion on LKML some corner cases and comments appeared
related to the design. This patch set address them keeping in mind
suggestions from Chanwoo Choi.
Tobias's paches:

Changes:
v2:
- refactored patchset and merget patch 1 and 3 as suggested by Chanwoo Choi,
- changed devfreq_{susped|resume}_device functions,
- added doxygen information for new entres in 'struct devfreq',
- devfreq_set_target skipped one argument, now resume_freq is set inside,
- minor changes addresing comments from maintainers regarding the style,

Regards,
Lukasz Luba
