Hi,

This patch is last three patch from https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/1/6/277.
because 1 and 2 patches have already been merged by Krzysztof.

This patchset adds support for the tm2 touchkey device.

The driver has been ported from Tizen Kernel, originally written
by Beomho. I ported it to the latest mainline Kernel.

Best Regard,
Jaechul

Changes in v6:
 - changed compatible name from samsaung to cypress. 
 - updated commit tags.
 - removed first two patches from the original patchset.
 
Changes in v5:
 - patch 1: removed a spurious regulator-always-off inherited from
   a different patch. Thanks Krzysztof.
 - patch 2: fixed a slip on  the model, thanks Javier (this patch
   confuses me quite a lot, this was all right some patches ago
   and re appeared on this one).
 - patch 2: removed 'regulator' label and used the original ldo3x
   labels. Krzysztof: it looks better indeed.
 - added Javier's reviews and Krzysztof's acks on the related
   patches.

Changes in v4:
 - patch 1 has been rebased on top of 7c294e002641 (arm64: dts:
   exynos: Remove unsupported regulator-always-off property from
   TM2E)
 - patch 2 has been generated with -B50% diff option using git
   2.11

Changes in v3:
 - Changed the commit ordering, the tm2-touchkey related patches
   are the last 3.
 - Added Chanwoo's patch which fixes the wrong voltage of ldo23
   and ldo25.
 - Andi (patch 3) moves the ldo31 and ldo38 in the tm2 and tm2e
   files as they have different values.

Changes in v2:
 - fixed reviews from Javier, Dmitry
 - refactored power enable/disable functions.
 - reordered signed-offs in patch 2, while patch 4 is left as it
   was as Andi copy pasted the node to the new tm2.dts file
 - added Jarvier's (patch 1,2,4) and Krzysztof's (patch 4)
   reviews
   and Rob's Ack
 - patch 3 diff has been generated with -B50%
