Hi Viresh,

I explained the relation between memory bus group and memory bus block on following patch[1].

Right.
But, the frequency of OPPs is only used for devfreq ondemand governor.
After deciding the proper frequency of memory bus on ondemand governor,
exynos-bus.c (exynos memory bus frequency driver) use the frequency table
of memory bus blocks on below to change the clock rate of memory bus block.

Firs of all,
I explain the hierarchy of Exynos memory buses.

For example of Exynos3250 memory bus,
This patch divide the memory bus group according to power rail (regulator).
- MIF (Memory Interface ) memory bus group uses the VDD_MIF regulator.
- INT (Internal) memory bus group uses the VDD_INT regulator.

Each memory bus group contains only one power rail(regulator) and one more memory bus blocks as follwing:

- MIF memory bus group                     
power rail(VDD_MIF)-->|--- memory bus for DMC (Dynamic Memory Controller) block (dmc clock)

- INT memory bus group
                      |--- memory bus for PERI block (aclk_100 clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for DISPLAY block (aclk_160 clock)
                      |  
                      |--- memory bus for ISP block (aclk_200 clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for GPS block (aclk_266 clock)
power rail(VDD_INT)-->|
                      |--- memory bus for MCUISP block (aclk_400_mcuisp clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for Leftbus block (gdl clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for Rightbus block (gdr clock)
                      |
                      |--- memory bus for MFC block (mfc clock)


Exynos3250 has following table for INT memory bus group:
All clocks of INT memory bus group have to contain the same entry count
againt the number of 'virtual freqw'. So, each memory bus clock could have duplicate clocks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level|virtual freq|PERI's clk|Display's clk|ISP's clk|GPS's clk| voltage|
------------------------------------------------------------------------
L6   |400000      |100000    |200000       |200000   |300000   | 95000  |
L5   |200000      |100000    |160000       |200000   |200000   | 95000  |
L4   |133000      |100000    |100000       |100000   |133000   | 92500  |
L3   |100000      |100000    |80000        |80000    |100000   | 85000  |
L2   |80000       |50000     |80000        |50000    |50000    | 85000  |
L1   |50000       |50000     |50000        |50000    |50000    | 85000  |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Except for mcuisp, leftbus, rightbus, mfc block)

This table is used for devfreq ondemand governor as following:
1. ondemand governor in devfreq use the 'virtual freq' to devcide the proper
   frequency for memory bus. 
2. ondemand governor executes the *_target() function to set clock rate and voltage.
3. *_target() function in exynos-bus.c changes the clock rate of {PERIS|Display|ISP|GPS} clk
   according to decided 'Level' by devfreq ondemand governor.

I explained it on the upper.
