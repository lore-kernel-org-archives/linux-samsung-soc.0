I am reading the other thread, let's see.

Great! That's means we are at least aligned on this topic. :-)

Currently this won't work.

That's because the buses' ->probe() are invoked in this path and they
are doing the attachment of the device to its PM domain.

In other words, we can't power up the PM domain using
pm_runtime_get_sync(), until the device has been attached to its PM
domain. Right?

I guess we could use notifiers, but I am not sure I see any benefit.
The code will be more complex and we need error handling as well.
