Yes, that's why we store all registers in suspend.

Nope, no recalc is needed. During suspend, the software logical state in clk
framework might not match the hardware in a few places: some provider's
internal muxes are reconfigured to lowest possible source (external
oscillator), because otherwise the hardware will lock the turning power
domain off. It is also a bit hard to say about provider's state when the
power domain is off, because the registers cannot be accessed at all (any
access will result external abort exception). However after resume, all
the mentioned muxes are restored to the values they had before the suspend,
so the hw state matches again the state in clock framework.

Well, in theory that disable_unprepare() has to be done in provider's remove
callback. But there is no exynos5433_cmu_remove function, because this 
driver
is so critical in the system, that it is marked with 
.suppress_bind_attrs and
hotplug/unplug is forbidden.

CLK_OF_DECLARE() initialized clocks also doesn't have any remove method.

Keeping this special parent clock enabled all the time is needed to make any
access to the given clock provider as well as even putting it into suspend.
Currently those clocks are marked with IS_CRITICAL flag in the parent
provider, but those flags might be removed once this patch is applied.

IMHO this can be only judged after some time, when more drivers will use 
this
feature.
