I've tested on S3C2440 SoC based board and I didn't notice any
issues with HZ=100.

Clock frequencies look a bit different because AFAIU MPLL
clock is mostly used as a root clock. The 12 MHz oscillator clock
is used a root clock for the MPLL.

refclk:    12000 kHz
mpll:     405000 kHz
upll:      48000 kHz
fclk:     405000 kHz
hclk:     101250 kHz
pclk:      50625 kHz

So frequency of the timer block's source clock (PCLK) is 50.625 MHz.
This is further divided by 50 in the prescaler as you pointed out.

So the 16-bit is clocked with 1012500 Hz clock. I added some printks
to verify this.

Here is boot log for HZ=200: http://pastebin.com/JuWZdYwh
and HZ=100 http://pastebin.com/HnDnBfhc

samsung_clocksource_init:351 pclk: 50625000, timer clock_rate: 1012500
sched_clock: 16 bits at 1012kHz, resolution 987ns, wraps every 32362962ns

I just don't understand why the log says timer overflow is every 32.362 ms
and not twice this value (65536 * 1/1012500).
