These are requirements written somewhere in the downstream tree... not
in upstream. Have in mind that someone may not be using Chrome OS on
Chromebook but custom U-Boot and different distro.

You cannot expect that everyone will new some requirements of some
downstream OS. If you need such requirements, write them in bindings
documentation *in the upstream*.
