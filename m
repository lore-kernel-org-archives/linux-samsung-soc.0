Hi Tomasz and Doug,

Thanks for the review.

I see USB2 currently using sysreg at boot-up, so I would assume that
it would fail if we have this clock turned off by the firmware. Have
not tested yet.

Yes, If the firmware gates sysreg then we should see failures at
boot-up or later.
Is this patch OK for now ? How would you guys like me to proceed on this ?
