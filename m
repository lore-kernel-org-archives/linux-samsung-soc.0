It is to prevent to add a new kernel parameter (with the documentation)
for a single driver which has a bogus idle state. If that could be
handled internally that would be cleaner.

Can you shortly describe what happens with the bootloader and AFTR ?

I guess you are not interested in cpuidle.off=3D1 because you want cpui=
dle
statistics for WFI, right ?
