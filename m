ok, TEMP, seems more crisp and clear.

sure,
means to say only mux-out clk can have multiple parents.

Well there will be one problem then. if CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag is
set, then set parent operation will happen on "current clk" and actual
rate change will happen on (top) "parent clk". If if this is handled
in .set_rate call back, the .set_rate will have no idea whose parent
need to be set temporarily.

or the suggestion is to implement specific call back for this clk.

Well if there are more than one temporary parents, and can be used in
different conditions, then that has to be decided at runtime. In that
case again you have to provide a .set_rate call back specific to that
clk.
But in common scenario this can not be the case as the purpose of temp
clk parent is well defined.

I still agree that CLK_SET_RATE_ALTERNATE can be done away, and
"set_parent" can be called if "clk->alter_parent" is set.
