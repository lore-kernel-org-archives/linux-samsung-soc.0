Yes, presumably this needs to be cleaned up. I was considering replacing
CONFIG_PM with CONFIG_PM_SLEEP, but that might involve some not trivial
changes. I'm going to have a look at it eventually.

Thanks, that seems a most reasonable fix. I was considering something like
that, just was afraid a bit to do this wide change and that it might cause
some other issues. Anyway that looks fine.
