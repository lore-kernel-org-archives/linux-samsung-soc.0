Well, the reason is simple: if you don't need to change something (i.e.
the change doesn't have any advantages), don't change it.

There is no difference between obtaining the rate from div_{arm,core}2
and armclk, so I don't see the point of changing this.

In fact now when thinking of it, this has revealed one hole that will be
unhandled by your code - if cpufreq is disabled and the bootloader
configures div_{arm,core}{,2} with non-zero values, armclk will return
incorrect rate. However since I haven't observed such case on existing
platforms, fixing this might be done on top of this series, in a
separate patch.

Best regards,
Tomasz
