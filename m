If I were a guessing man (which I'm not), I'd guess that perhaps
you're running into troubles with our friend the PL330.

There appear to be strange issues with the PL330 on Rockchip SoCs.  I
was only peripherally involved with them, but I know at least about
some of the patches in our tree, like:

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/237607
=46ROMLIST: DMA: pl330: support burst mode for dev-to-mem and mem-to-de=
v transmit

CHROMIUM: dmaengine: pl330: support quirks for some broken

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/237396
CHROMIUM: dmaengine: pl330: add quirk for broken no flushp
