I am sorry but I am still unable to see what is broken and what are
you trying to fix. I asked what is broken and you replied that there
is a sensor, there is a clock, drivers use clk_prepare_enable and some
more parameter need to be tuned... None of these are answers to
question - what is broken. How can I reproduce the problem?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
