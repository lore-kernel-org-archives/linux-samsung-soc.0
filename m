Well, the question is what will the above sequence do without my patches?

IMO the only result of above calls is (optionally) changed rate of parent
clocks and appropriate values written to given clock's registers, so next
time one calls clk_(prepare)_enable(), the given clock will be enabled
with the configured rate.

With runtime pm patches the overall result will be the same. However, if
the given clock is the only/last enabled clock from the provider, there
might be a runtime pm resume/suspend transition (2 times: one from
prepare/unprepare calls, the second from set_rate calls). This means that
the rate of parent clocks (especially if they comes from the other
providers) might or might not change between those transitions. This
depends how the runtime pm is implemented and what operations has to be
done for putting provider into suspend mode. The final result will be
however the same as without runtime pm patches.

Clock provider's runtime pm suspend callback should save internal
configuration and resume callback must restore it completely, so the
provider's internal state is exactly the same as before suspend. If we
assume that clock provider might be in a power domain, the internal
clock provider's hardware context might be lost after suspend callback.

If you prefer that, I will move runtime pm related bits to 
__clk_core_init then.
