Thanks!. Will do that next time.

Since the CPU clock is a composite clock with dividers and muxes, the
latency includes the settling time for these clock blocks as well. I
have not made any measurements of the clock transition latency.

This was a mistake. I did not intend to add regulator for cpu4 as well
but somehow I missed it. I will remove it in the next version.

The big.little cpufreq driver expects each CPU to have the clock
latency specified.
