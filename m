The cpufreq driver will be removed completely in v4.3 or v4.4 with
patchset adding cpufreq-dt support for Exynos 4x12. This means that this
patch makes sense only for 4.2 and as a stable backport (but it was not
marked as such).

Anyone thinks that the patch will be worth stable back-porting?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
