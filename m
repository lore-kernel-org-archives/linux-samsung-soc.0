IMO, I think you you should just start collecting fixes and features and
queuing them for Kukjin and then start working as a co-maintainer.

The samsung platforms have been in a near constant state of breakage
over the last *several* cycles, and something really needs to change in
how these are being monitored and maintained.

If someone else is paying closer attention, especially to important
fixes like this and the recent ones for other imprecies aborts etc.,
all of us who are trying to use these Exynos platforms with mainline
will be in much better shape.

Kevin
