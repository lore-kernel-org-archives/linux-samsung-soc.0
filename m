THIS IS A RESEND OF ONCE MERGED INTO kgene/for-next AND LOST PATCHES

Series v5 got merged in kgene/for-next but due to last moment change before pull
these patches were not accepted during 4.3 merge window.After that kgene/for-next
got rebased over 4.4-rc1 these patches got dropped into another branch and till
date not included to for-next.

Since then due to minor change in "drivers/soc/", patches are not getting applied
cleanly so rebasing on current for-next and resending all these with fix in memory
mapping included.


This patch set adds support for Exynos SROM controller DT based driver.
Currently SROM register sets are used only during S2R, so driver
basically added for taking care of S2R. It will help us in removing
static mapping from exynos.c and other extra code handline during S2R.

This patch set also updated exynos4 and exynos5 dtsi files for with device
node for srom, and added binding documentation for the same.

First two patches are some minor cleanup in mach-exynos.

This patchset, I have tested on Peach-Pi (Exynos5880) based chromebook for boot
and S2R functionality.
