This series replaces existing cpufreq driver for Exynos4210 and
Exynos5250 which impact 7 Exynos boards - Exynos4210 (smdk, origen,
trats, universal), Exynos5250 (smdk, arndale, snow). Out of these, it
is trats and universal that have not been tested. Which other 15
Exynos boards did you feel this series needs to be tested on? Sanity
testing for Exynos4x12 cpufreq support was done on Exynos4412 Origen
board.

Aren't Tegra/OMAP baseline tests for upstream kernel versions only,
not for linux-next?
