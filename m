That's not what has been said.

What might happen is this.

parent (gate)
  |
  +------> clock A (sound)
  |
  +------> clock B (display)

So. Let's say that at boot, we have parent enabled, and display
enabled, and that the display have been setup.

We have a sound driver that is going to probe. If at *any* point in
time, the sound driver is to disable its clock, the clock framework,
since there's no registered user left of the parent clock, will
disable the parent clock as well, effectively disabling the display
clock.

This can happen for various reason: failed probe, PM, whatever, or
even if the sound clock is to be reparented.

Quite frankly, I think that's definitely something we need to worry
about.

Two use cases, one single driver, and a proper way to prevent all the
issues your solution doesn't address, like the one we saw above, or
preventing the clock rate to change.
