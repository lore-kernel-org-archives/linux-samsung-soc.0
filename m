As long as we use correct exynos5422-odroidxu4.dtb is used in the
boot.scr/boot.ini ethernet come up,
build and tested using CONFIG_USB_RTL8152=m using multi_v7_defconfig.

Not sure what is the policy for NFS booting.

Do you want CONFIG_USB_RTL8152 to be build as module in
exynos/multi_v7_defconfig.
