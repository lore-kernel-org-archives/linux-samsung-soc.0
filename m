Hi All,

Uh... just finished reading this thread and finally decided to add my 5 cents here
as I've already had very bad experience with some changes introduced to DD/PM core :(
(just check the history of the change 1e2ef05bb
"PM: Limit race conditions between runtime PM and system sleep (v2)"

Amba bus is not good example as for me, because it's cheating ;)
Why? Bus/Host can't know when its child device is powered on or not unless it's
been notified directly about that and, therefor it's not correct to call
pm_runtime_set_active() from amba_probe() - instead it should be called from driver.
For example:
drivers/mmc/host/mmci.c will be active only when its functional clock is enabled.

Apparently someone decided to save few lines of code.

So, few points below:
1) It will be good to treat Generic Power domain as new feature (in 3.18 there are
 only 5 users of it). From another side, there are at about 500 users of Runtime PM.
So, Problems discussed here could be treated as not related to Runtime PM but rather
related to GPD ;)

For example (lets use AMBA bus):
- after the commit 207f1a2d "amba: Add support for attach/detach of PM domains" 
and if any device of amba bus will be added to some GPD then
amba_pm_runtime_suspend/resume callbacks will never be called for this device and 
"apb_pclk" will not be enabled/disabled.
Simply because GPD will set dev->pm_domain == &genpd->domain, which PM ops will have higher
priority for Runtime PM than Bus PM ops.

2) There are no requirements for arch/platforms/drivers to work in both cases
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y/n. But they must be built without errors/warning for both
cases. 

For example, for Keystone 2 only CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME=y is going to be supported
and if some one decided to disable it - it can be perfectly done from sys_fs/
user space.

3) pm_runtime_get_sync()(or similar) is good not only because i's waking up device, but also
because:
- it can wake up chain of devices (dev->parent->parent->...)
- it can wake up power domain
- it connects device to domain/class/type/bus and so allow to add additional PM layer on top
  of Platform bus (for example arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_device.c).

So, it will do all needed things, and if it doesn't that problem is in platfrom/bus/driver
code and not in Runtime PM. 
if pm_runtime_get_sync() will be dropped - than all above will need to be implemented
around the ->probe().

4) I've copied here comment from Rafael:

 Agree, that's a little bit annoying, but we are living with that for more then
 5 years already (I'm 3 years) - so, I am, as driver developer, expecting above behavior
 (just walk through the drivers and you will see how many drivers expecting the same).

So, any volunteers to check and fix ~500 drivers.

Looks like it's done now. is it?

It should prevent enabling/disabling of RPM from sys_fs too.

Here I'm still think that pm_runtime_get_sync() (or similar) API should work.
Another way, PM domain should decide what to do when the first device attached to it
- power up and stay powered on for example
 (It will work if devices are attached before ->probe();
  it will not work if devices will be attached once they've been created, but this is different
  question)

I would like to take the liberty to add a couple of points from me:
 - it seems reasonable to have ability to disable Runtime PM globally from sys_fs:
   once disabled - "get" should power on device, "put" should do nothing all the
   time except when ->remove() is called.
 
 - It might be reasonable to add API like pm_runtime_probe_getXXX() which will do
   everything what standard pm_runtime_get_sync() is doing with one exception:
   it will not call driver's .runtime_resume() callback.

 - Just opinion. For GPD, It looks like integration/design problem and may be
   it shouldn't be integrated with Runtime PM through dev_pm_ops. Instead, it
   might be better to invoke it directly from  RPM core.
