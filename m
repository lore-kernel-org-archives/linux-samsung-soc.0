Thanks a lot for the explanation. I see the NOTE at the bottom of section
7.9.1.159 CLK_GATE_BUS_TOP that mentions that. I'll add this information
to the commit message when posting as a proper patch instead of a RFC.

I confirmed that changing the patch to prevent "aclk266_g2d" to be gated
instead of "mdm0" also makes the system to resume correctly from suspend
so I'll change that on the patch as well.

I see that many of the Exynos5420 clocks (including "aclk266_g2d") use the
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag but AFAIU it only prevents the common clock framework
to disable the clocks on init but doesn't prevent the clocks to be disabled
if all the clock childs are gated so the parent is gated as well.

For now I'll just add "aclk266_g2d" but later if needed all the GATE_BUS_TOP
clocks (and others) that should only be gated when CG_STATUS is 0 can be
added. My patch iterates over a list of clocks to be kept during suspend even
when there is only one for now so adding more later if needed will be trivial.

Or do you think that I should add all the GATE_BUS_TOP clocks now?

Great, I'll wait a couple of days to see if others have more comments about
the last RFC I shared [0] and I'll post it as a proper patch.

Thanks a lot for all your help and best regards,
