Not necessarily. If this feature is worth it, then sure, but otherwise it 
would be just wasted effort.

If this is what you are asking about:
 - Universal C210 with Exynos 4210 rev 0.0,
 - Trats with Exynos 4210 rev. 1.1.

OK. I misunderstood you previously then, taking interrupts disabled as 
interrupts signals masked in the controller.

I was unable to find any measurement results or even any other rationale. 
Would you mind pointing me to them? Thanks in advance.

OK, thanks.

Hmm? As I said, I couldn't find any results of that work.

Well, first of all, it has not been upstreamed correctly: a) without any 
given rationale (or at least without any I could find) and b) without enough 
testing.

Well, everything you're saying is correct, assuming that this feature is 
useful, which needs confirmation. I'd still want any evidence of this 
feature being of any use first, to not waste time on something that is 
useless.
