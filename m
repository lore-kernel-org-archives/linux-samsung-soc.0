I think that either we treat this as an ABI break, or just "being
nice to downstream".

In the first case, not breaking things would be a valid reason. But I
believe this is not an ABI break. ABI is about an interface, not about
being nice. The SCU should be defined by downstream users because this
is the description of the hardware. In the same time, kernel did not
document as an interface something like "there should be no SCU node
defined" so creating a requirement of SCU is not an breakage of existing
interface.

The second case then, being nice to downstream. Do we want to be nice or
do we want to push them to mainline? Okay, it is never black or white...
yet we should rather encourage downstream to mainline and creating
compatibility periods is rather opposite of that.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
