Well, I don't think so. I'd like to ask why you _do_ think the meaning of
machine is bigger than board. General robot field?...Nobody knows machine
does not mean board in the arch/arm/ kernel.

If we use the meaning what you said the contrary is rather to be supposed.
The confusion can be caused.
And how about machine_is_xxx() and CONFIG_MACH_XXX for board?

...

Anyway, the board-xxx.c file can be used for it later but as I said, if
required, we need to change it all at once in samsung stuff not just for
TRATS board.

Thanks.

Kgene.
