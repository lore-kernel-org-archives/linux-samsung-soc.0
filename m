Below is the mapping of calls from pwm driver.
I have tried to map the functionality and I am trying to understand
the flow of the driver.

Also looking in document

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/pwm.txt

pwm-samsung driver controls the LEDS, fans...etc

Form the dts modes pwmleds

        pwmleds {
                compatible = "pwm-leds";

                blueled {
                        label = "blue:heartbeat";
                        pwms = <&pwm 2 2000000 0>;
                        pwm-names = "pwm2";
                        max_brightness = <255>;
                        linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
                };
        };

Following is the map out from the device tree.

pwms = <&pwm 2 2000000 0>;

&pwm       ->  pwm: pwm@12dd0000 --->samsung,exynos4210-pwm
2              ->  period
2000000    ->  duty_cycle
0              ->  polarity

And here is the mapping of the call of function
Note: This function call are as per my understanding of the flow in
the driver. I might be wrong.

pwm_samsung_set_polarity(struct pwm_chip *chip, struct pwm_device
*pwm, enum pwm_polarity polarity)
\
 pwm_samsung_set_invert(our_chip, pwm->hwpwm, invert);
 \
  pwm_set_polarity(struct pwm_device *pwm, enum pwm_polarity polarity)
  \
   pwm->chip->ops->set_polarity(pwm->chip, pwm, polarity);
    \
     pwm_enable(struct pwm_device *pwm) or pwm_disable(struct pwm_device *pwm)

pwm_enable or pwm_disable will be triggered on change in pwm->flags by
the pwm core.
before pwm_set_polarity is called form the Samsung driver it hold with
following locks

Here is the locking

pwm_samsung_set_polarity(struct pwm_chip *chip, struct pwm_device
*pwm, enum pwm_polarity polarity)
 \
  pwm_samsung_set_invert(struct samsung_pwm_chip *chip, unsigned int
channel, bool invert)
    \
     spin_lock_irqsave(&samsung_pwm_lock, flags);
      \
       pwm_set_polarity(struct pwm_device *pwm, enum pwm_polarity polarity)
       \
        mutex_lock(&pwm->lock)

          pwm_enable(struct pwm_device *pwm) or pwm_disable(struct
pwm_device *pwm)
          \
           mutex_lock(&pwm->lock);

Problem I see that we are holding the lock in interrupt context.
I don't know how the this triggers this bug.

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.c:97

Please let me know if I am wrong.
