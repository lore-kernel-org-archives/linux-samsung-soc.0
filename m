I was thinking about setting status = "disabled" on the IOMMU nodes, not 
removing the IOMMU references in the bus master nodes.

Setting iommu=off sounds fine to me. The IOMMU core would then return a "no 
IOMMU present" error instead of -EPROBE_DEFER, and probing of the bus masters 
would continue without IOMMU support.
