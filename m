The Maxim MAX77686 PMIC is a multi-function device with regulators,
clocks and a RTC. The DT bindings for the clocks are in a separate
file but the bindings for the regulators are inside the mfd part.

To make it consistent with the clocks portion of the binding and
because is more natural to look for regulator bindings under the
bindings/regulator sub-directory, split the regulator portion of
the DT binding and add it as a separate file.

Changes in v3:
- Add Krzysztof Kozlowski Reviewed-by tag to patch #4.
- Add Lee Jones Acked-by tag to patch #4.

Changes in v2:
- Use a generic name for the max77686 node in the regulator example.
