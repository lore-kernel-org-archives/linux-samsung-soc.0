The long case statements and conditionals in this patch make it pretty
dense/ugly -- can you think of a way to avoid doing this to the code?
Also, it would be good to hear if anyone else has tested/is using this
patch.

Is having a new mmc_card_hs200() test desirable, compared to just
reusing mmc_card_highspeed() and checking the ext_csd.card_type?

Thanks,

- Chris.
