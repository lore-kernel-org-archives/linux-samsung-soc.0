Will add some explanation in the example, for it to be clear.

Actually, i wanted to move down the of_get_child_by_name() to before
of_property_read_u32() call.

I'm trying not to touch the non-DT part of the code.

struct s3c64xx_spi_csinfo *cs = spi->controller_data;

This will update the cs->line and cs->fb_delay in case of non-DT.

This is to keep the non-DT part untouched.

Will re-spin after waiting for a couple of more comments.
Thanks for your review.
