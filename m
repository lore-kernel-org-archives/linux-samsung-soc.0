Well, not really. clock controller's runtime pm functions must not call
clk_prepare/unprepare yet.

I didn't get your question. I thought that you are asking if my change
won't introduce any deadlock related to prepare and dev->pm locks. My
runtime pm functions doesn't do any call to clk_prepare/unprepare.
Although global clock prepare lock is re-entrant from the same process, it
would cause deadlock if called from runtime pm functions, because runtime
pm functions might be called from the worker running on the different
cpu/process.

I hope that the work started by Krzysztof Kozlowski on splitting prepare
lock on per-controller basis will solve limitation and one would be able
to call clk_prapare/unprepare on clocks from other controllers even from
the runtime pm functions.
