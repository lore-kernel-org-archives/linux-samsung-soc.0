Looks like I missed it, I will add this in the next patch,

Changes were made to support Sandisk Ultra UHS-I class 10 card support.
OdroidXU3/XU4 board would not boot up using this card.

Depending on the capability of the UHS-I card, the speed of the card
is selected.
I have just added the enhance capability feature to support them.

On warm boot: i.e reboot of the board.
[    4.649073] mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 50000000Hz (slot
req 50000000Hz, actual 50000000HZ div = 0)
[    4.657555] mmc1: new high speed SDHC card at address aaaa
[    4.663787] mmcblk0: mmc1:aaaa SL32G 29.7 GiB
[    4.669206]  mmcblk0: p1 p2

On cold boot:: ie: power on the board.

[    4.630237] mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 100000000Hz (slot
req 100000000Hz, actual 100000000HZ div = 0)
[    4.639820] mmc1: new ultra high speed SDR50 SDHC card at address aaaa
[    4.646266] mmcblk0: mmc1:aaaa SL32G 29.7 GiB
[    4.650293] IRQ56 no longer affine to CPU7
[    4.650581] CPU7: shutdown
[    4.658293]  mmcblk0: p1 p2

Note: Their is need to reset the PMIC
S2MPS11_REG_L13CTRL/S2MPS11_REG_L19CTRL registers
         to support this feature consistently on every reboot.
