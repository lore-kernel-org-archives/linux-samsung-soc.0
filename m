OK I think I get it now, so DT bindings shall really NOT be read
by any of the pinctrl core, it is *supposed* to be all driver-specific.
Then it makes perfect sense to have it as it is.

So for example in the pinctrl-coh901xxx.c example driver I have
locally defined registers presets like:

#define U300_FLOATING_INPUT { \
        .bias_mode = PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE, \
        .output = false, \
}

#define U300_PULL_UP_INPUT { \
        .bias_mode = PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP, \
        .output = false, \
}

Then this type of stuff shall keep its custom format in the device
tree, and the driver for coh901xxx reads that out.

Thanks for helping me understand this crucial assumption of how
it works...

Yours,
Linus Walleij
