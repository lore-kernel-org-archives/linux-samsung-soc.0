Yes, writel() is always the safe choice if you don't know what to
use. __raw_writel() should be considered an implementation detail
and not used in drivers at all. There is also writel_relaxed(),
which is faster than writel() because it leaves out all the
barriers (as __raw_writel does too), and you can sometimes use that
in the fast path if you can prove that no barriers are needed.
