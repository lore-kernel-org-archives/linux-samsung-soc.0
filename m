Yes, having a stage that fixes up broken device trees makes a lot of
sense. It can likely be plugged into the machine descriptor today per
platform, since I think most things we have going on right now are
platform-specific quirks.

I'm strongly against doing this outside of the kernel, since they're
closely tied together today. We've always had the quirk tables for
devices in the kernel, and we used to do this a long time ago on
powerpc as well (we did it before we built the flat DT out of the OF
equivalent there, most of the time).

As already argued, there are good reasons to sometimes allow this, as
long as it can be expected that it's something that's just used during
early boot. For example, having DEBUG_LL output on a pre-mapped
framebuffer could be really useful. Once DRM comes up, it'll tear down
the existing one.
