I'm not trying to go behind anyone's back, if that's your concern. I
fully intend to obtain every maintainer's explicit acknowledgement
before removing any feature from the kernel. The warning above is there
to get the maintainers attention on the disrupting effect of this series.

able to find a publicly available TRM for any of the Samsung platforms,
so this one could be different (but I really doubt it somehow).

The main problem is that they are not general-purpose interrupt
controllers. They all come first on the interrupt path, and somehow feed
two signals into the GIC: the actual interrupt, and the bypass signal.

None of that is representable in DT. I'm willing to take any idea though.

Thanks,
