Hi,

+Cc Marek, Bartlomiej, Kukjin Kim,


I would like to bring back this topic. Unfortunately I don't have
access to source code of BL1 (or any other firmware blob) so my
knowledge here comes mostly from experimenting and from looking at
sources of vendor kernel for Gear 2 (Exynos3250) and SM-G900H (Galaxy
S5, Exynos5422).

It seems that some booting firmware (I would suspect BL1 because this
ships Samsung to Hardkernel) uses SPARE2 as synchronization mechanism.
For example vendor kernel, when booting little core, it waits till
SPARE2==1 and then executes software reset for this core.

Observations shown that BL1 for Odroid, when booting secondary little core:
1. Expects that SPARE2 register will be initialized to 1.
2. If it is, then it sets it to 0, proceeds further and little core boots.
3. If it is not, then it sets it to 1 and waits. Maybe this is a
notification to userspace - reset me please!

Unfortunately executing software reset in that time (at point 3)
stopped kernel from booting. No logs/dmesg and I was unable to turn on
early printk.

The answer why two of little cores boot is quite simple now. At
beginning the SPARE2==0 so first little core will set it to 1 and wait
till software reset. Kernel timeouts on this CPU bring up so it starts
the sequence for next little core. Now the SPARE2==1 so the core boots
fine and SPARE2 is set to 0. The last little core starts from
SPARE2==0, sets it to 1 and waits for software reset.

Since no one knows how this exactly works and we are stuck with BL1
provided as is, then IMHO the patch makes sense.

Kevin, can you refresh the patch?
It would be nice to:
1. set SPARE2 only for Odroid (of_machine_is_compatible()),
2. extend the explanation.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
