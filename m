Hi,

I'll send this patch on behalf of Jaechul Lee
<jcsing.lee@samsung.com> becasue it's I don't want to block
anyone who wants to make changes to the exynos5433-tm2*dts*
files.

This patches are based on Krzysztof's branch for-next [1]

    "This patchset adds support for the tm2 touchkey device.
     
     The driver has been ported from Tizen Kernel,
     originally written
     by Beomho. I ported it to the latest mainline Kernel."

Thanks,
Andi

   and ldo25.

Changes in v2:

   reviews
   and Rob's Ack
