Thanks, applied!

I haven't been sure how to handle this patch; in general cosmetic
patches that touch many parts of many files are a bad idea, because they
break the ability to merge patches.  Since we're getting near the end of
merging the 3.2 merge window patches, though, maybe now is a good time.

If this patch starts causing merge conflicts, I might pull it out later
or remove the modifications for the most common files (core.c/sd.c/sdhci.c).

Thanks,

- Chris.
