XFER_COMPLETE didn't necessarily precede data error.  Imagine this scenario:

1. Check for data error: nope
2. Interrupt happens and we get a data error and immediately xfer complete
3. Check for xfer complete: yup

That's the state that we are handling.

The system that dw_mmc uses where the interrupt handler has no locking
makes it incredibly difficult to get things right.  Can you propose an
alternate fix that would avoid the race?

This was an alternate fix for the above, but appears to actually hit
in practice too.

Said another way: if we don't add the extra checking for
EVENT_DATA_ERROR (above) we'll end up here.  ...and if we ever get
into this "else" and don't do _something_ then we'll wedge forever.
