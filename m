Could you point which other driver needs similar fix? Here in cpufreq-dt
the problem was caused by using regulator api (indirectly) from
->init(). All other drivers, which have regulators support, are for old,
obsolete, uni-processor systems, which don't have the problem of
secondary cpu suspend during system suspend/resume cycle.
