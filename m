Since we're talking slots / cards on a bus, I think the addressing
model would be useful here. So in the main controller node:
    #address-cells =3D <1>;
    #size-cells =3D <0>;

And then each slot would need a reg property and possibly unit address:

   slot {
        reg =3D <0>;
        ...
   };

(unit addresses on the slots are only needed if they can't be
disambiguated by name, so not needed if you only have one slot).
