Hi Chris,

Yeah, you're right. The sdhci-s3c's maintainer is Ben Dooks. So if get a his
ack, it's best. But if you're ok this, in my opinion, you can merge this.
And as I'm a maintainer of Samsung stuff with Ben Dooks, I already merged
regarding patches, such as sdhci-s3c platform handling into my tree for 37
merge window.
...

Ben, could you please check this patch?...this is ok to me for Samsung
HSMMC...if any opinions, please kindly let us know.

Thanks.

Best regards,
Kgene.
