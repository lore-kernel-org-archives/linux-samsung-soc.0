What do you mean?  Do you mean you just forgot to add them, or you
created them so long ago before there was a stable@kernel.org?

Are these in Linus's tree already?  If so, send me the git commit ids
and I will add them to the stable kernels.

If not, wait until they are, and then send me the git commit ids, and I
will then add them.

Before they get to Linus, there's nothing I can do with them, and I
don't accept pull requests as that makes no sense when it comes to the
stable kernel patch flow.

Does this help?
