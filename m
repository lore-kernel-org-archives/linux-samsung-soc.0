I agree with Mr. Shim here. using initcall doesn't look like a solution
to this issue. Neither compile time dependency is of much help.

The S3C framebuffer driver can be used as a loadable module, how
would initcalls be supposed to work then ?

Some notify mechanisms or deferred probing could be used, to make sure one
of drivers is initialized before the other.
