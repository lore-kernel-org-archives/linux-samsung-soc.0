The current exynos-iommu(System MMU) driver does not work autonomously
since it is lack of support for power management of peripheral blocks.
For example, MFC device driver must ensure that its System MMU is disabled
before MFC block is power-down not to invalidate IOTLB in the System MMU
when I/O memory mapping is changed. Because A System MMU is resides in the
same H/W block, access to control registers of System MMU while the H/W
block is turned off must be prohibited.

This set of changes solves the above problem with setting each System MMUs
as the parent of the device which owns the System MMU to recieve the
information when the device is turned off or turned on.

Another big change to the driver is the support for devicetree.
The bindings for System MMU is described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/samsung/system-mmu.txt

In addition, this patchset also includes several bug fixes and enhancements
of the current driver.

Change log:
v2:
- Split the patch to iommu/exynos into 9 patches
- Support for System MMU 3.3
- Some code compaction

v3:
- Fix prefetch buffer flag definition for System MMU 3.3 (patch 10/12)
- Fix incorrect setting for SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS (patch 09/12)
   Thanks to Prathyush.
