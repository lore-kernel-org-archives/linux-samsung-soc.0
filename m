Please use another way something like check ARM core rather than use
'soc_is_xxx()', as you know it is not acceptable now even it is just
moving/modifying exist function though.

And please make sure your updates don't hurt other exynos5 stuff. Any
tests on exynos5 platforms would be helpful.

And I don't think the fix should be sent to 'stable' because I can't se=
e
the 'add node for L2$ controller' in v3.19...looks applied from v4.0-rc=
=2E..

One more if you have any doubts, I'd like to ask you to contact S.LSI
guys who have created the vendor codes not assume with the code because
maybe the vendor code you mentioned cannot cover all exynos stuff I
think. Then we could make more clear pm codes in mainline. To be honest
I'm not a Power Management hardware guy so I don't know every regarding
PM stuff in exynos SoCs, I can contact them easier though...I mean
please don't assume any hardware behavior with just vendor code. Please
ask, you have an access in Samsung intranet before posting something
like this...Hope let's make a better fix together during -rc.

Thanks,
Kukjin
