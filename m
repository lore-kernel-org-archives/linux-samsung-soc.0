Yes, this is how we manage the i2c controller on OMAP.

Essentially, between every xfer, the hw is disabled and can potentially
lose context, so eveery xfer requires a hw init.  We use the runtime PM
"autosuspend" feature so that it stays alive for X milliseconds so
bursty i2c xfers are not punished.   

Have a look at drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-omap.c.

You'll notice there are not callbacks for system suspend/resume, it's
only doing runtime PM.
