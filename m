The mux which is used to re-parent is part of the larger opaque cpu
clock type (more like the composite clock). So I am not sure how this
isn't compliant with ccf.

The highbank-cpufreq.c file was introduced because platforms using
this driver did not have the usual regulator to control the voltage.
The first commit of this driver explains this (copied below).

"Highbank processors depend on the external ECME to perform voltage
management based on a requested frequency. Communication between the
A9 cores and the ECME happens over the pl320 IPC channel."

So those platforms had no choice but to use an alternative approach to
control the voltage (and reuse cpufreq-cpu0 as much as possible). The
case with exynos is a different one. cpufreq-cpu0 is fully re-usable
for exynos with the additional support for "safe voltage". If we agree
that there might be existing or future platforms with single
clock/voltage rail that require the "safe voltage" feature, then
adding "safe voltage" support in cpufreq-cpu0 driver seems to be the
right approach.

Agreed, it is a corner case. But for this corner case, we are
performing some additional actions on the same regulator which is used
in the normal functioning of the driver.

I have made a related comment on this above.

highbank cpufreq driver is intended for a different purpose so I don't
think it can be reused for exynos. Yes, we can make exynos specific
hacks into highbank driver but how would that be better over the
approach in this patch?
