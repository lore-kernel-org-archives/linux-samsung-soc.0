Yes, pm_runtime_set_active() is not used in probe(), I believe this
is not required. In case of those IP blocks there is no use of activating
them during probe(). Instead we check if PM_RUNTIME is enabled through
pm_runtime_enabled() helper and enable the device clock(s) if not.
I agree it all doesn't quite work in current mainline for !PM_RUNTIME,
since there is nothing ensuring that the power domains are enabled
in such kernel configuration.

They wouldn't similarly work with pm_runtime_set_active() call in probe()
with CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME disabled, would they ?

Especially it might be interesting look at gscaler, where there are 
multiple instances of same device handled by one driver.

Thanks, I will be able to take a look at this the earliest on Monday.

I see, fortunately the genpd API appears not to be wildly used yet.
