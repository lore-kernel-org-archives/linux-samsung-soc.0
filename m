Is the 80mA power saving comparing with:

 * (cpu0/cpu1 online) vs (cpu0 AFTR and cpu1 offline)
or
 * (cpu0 AFTR and cpu1 offline) vs (cpu0 WFI and cpu1 offline)

?

May be we were not working on the same tree.

I am on the linux-pm-next tree.

Now the merge window occurred, the AFTR is no longer working on my boar=
d.

After git bisecting:

commit 87107d89052bcec1fe91b309631de4ed294a5171

    ARM: EXYNOS: Remove legacy L2X0 initialization

    Since Exynos is now supporting only DT-based boot, the old L2X0
    initialization code is not needed anymore, so exynos4_l2x0_cache_in=
it()
    can be greatly simplified.

Reverting the patch solves the problem.

Any ideas ?
