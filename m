Not really. For PLLs used for general purpose clocking, like for CPU or 
GPU, there is usually no need to achieve certain frequency. Actually you 
might want to have as many as possible intermediate steps to improve 
frequency scaling efficiency.

Well, this is not really about memory, but rather the amount of code in 
the driver. The amount of memory needed for such setting table is rather 
insignificant.

Another thing worth knowing would be whether a different frequency of 
input clock is really allowed or the SoC supports only 24 MHz. If the 
latter is the case, then there is no need to bother supporting other 
frequencies.

I'm waiting for some opinion from hardware engineers then.
