I must agree with Mike here. In my opinion the above approach is more
compliant with CCF (as I've pointed it out in my other comment - the
cpu_clk has more than one parent and we could switch between them when
needed).

If the clk_set_parent() approach is not suitable, then cannot we
consider using the one from highbank-cpufreq.c?

Here we have cpufreq-cpu0.c which sets voltage of the cpu_clk. 
In the highbank-cpufreq.c there are clock notifiers to change the
voltage.

Cannot Exynos reuse such approach? Why shall we pollute cpufreq-cpu0.c
with another solution?

I think that there is a logical distinction between setting voltage for
cpufreq-cpu0 related clock and increasing voltage of reparented clock.

The former fits naturally to cpufreq-cpu0, when the latter seems like
some corner case (as Mike pointed out) for Exynos.

Thomas, what do you think about highbank-cpufreq.c approach (with
using clock notifiers)? 

Do you think, that it is feasible to reuse it with Exynos?
