I checked. sclk_uart is enabled properly by serial driver. But for some reason,
if I remove INGNORE flag, system throws "imprecise external abort (0x1406) at
0x00000000".

But it is completely fine with sclk_uartX are declared with IGNORE
flag. I am not
able to find any clue at software level. Probably we can accept Uart clocks with
this flag for exynos5260.

I have already posted V4 for this series where I addressed most of
your review comments.
Please review.

Rahul Sharma.
