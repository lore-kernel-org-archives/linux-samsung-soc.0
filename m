Arnd already said that it looks good:

Is is really needed? I thought that this case is already handled by device
core. It works perfectly fine for Exynos IOMMU and its client devices for
suspend/resume too, which rely on pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume().

Do you have any particular case in mind? Device links ensures that pl330 
will
suspended after its slave devices and waken before them. Is there anything
more needed here?

I'm open for suggestions.
