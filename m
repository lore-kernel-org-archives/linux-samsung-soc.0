If you're only testing linux-next, then you have a hole in your test
regime.

As I've said, I'm omitting patches 4 and 9.  Patch 9 is the troublesome
patch and can't be merged anyway since patch 4 is going via the STi
maintainer along with other changes.  The remainder of the patch set
are all specific to individual platforms, some of which have been
acked, but most platform maintainers have not responded in _any_ way.

You are aware that the autobuilders do build patches sent to the
mailing list, and then we have kernelci which builds my tree, builds
linux-next etc.  There's multiple stages of build test that such
stuff goes through.

Lastly, linux-next is not a general test tree, it is for integration
testing of code destined for the _NEXT_ merge window.  The clue is
in the name.  It is not for code destined for the following merge
window - only code for _this_ merge window should be in linux-next.
