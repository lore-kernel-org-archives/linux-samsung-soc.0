Thanks for the patch.

In case of Exynos, the booting CPU always has these information in DT
and the booting CPU cannot be changed (chosen by firmware/hardware
configuration). Therefore there is no real risk of falling although
for correctness of DT your change makes sense.

It is too late for this cycle for me so I'll pick it up after merge window.
Alternatively, arm-soc guys can pick it up directly with my tag:
