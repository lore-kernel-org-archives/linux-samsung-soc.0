Ok. Will fix.

It is almost the same as in Exynos5 but few register bits have been
changed. So we have added a new compatible string.

Ok.

The dwmmc controller in Exynos7 is not fully backward compatible with
Exynos5. Specifically, it requires 64-bit related changes for IDMAC
and handling the changes in register offsets.
