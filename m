The main argument, from my point of view, is that handling IOMMUs are normal 
platform devices allow using all the kernel infrastructure that depends on a 
struct device. The dev_* print helpers are nice to have, but what would make a 
big difference is the ability to use runtime PM.

I'm not advocating for IOMMU support being built as a loadable module. It 
might be nice from a development point of view, but that's about it.
