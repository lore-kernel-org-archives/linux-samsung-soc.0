Hi,

Patchset adds necessary clocks, reorganizes existing stuff and finally
adds Odroid XU support.


Changes since v4
================
1. Patch 20: Remove the nodes in exynos5420.dtsi (before they were
   actually just copied instead of moving).

Changes since v3
================
1. Get rid of 5 patches changing the fin_pll after talk with Tomasz
   Figa. The existing definition of oscillator in exynos5410.dtsi
   is preferred over solution chosen for Exynos5420.
   This simplifies also the merging strategy.
2. Add tags from Javier (tested and reviewed).

Patchset is available at my private repo @github:
https://github.com/krzk/linux.git for-next/odroid-xu-v4
(I have some more changes coming but I think it is easier for
reviewers if the patchset does not grow infinitely)


Changes since v2
================
1. Got global-ack from Stephen for the clock changes. I think merging
   everything through arm-soc might be the easiest but:
   a. In such case I will prepare a tag with clock changes,
   b. Anyway I will wait for response from Sylwester and Tomasz.
2. Applied comments from Javier and added his Reviewed-by.
3. Patch 22: added ack from Rob.
4. Minor improvements in existing patches.
5. Five new patches at the end: 23-27 (not reviewed yet).
   Some of them could be squashed with existing ones but existing
   changes got reviews. Although the final Odroid XU DTS works fine but
   in general this is still work-in-progress so I suspect it will grow.
   I am releasing it early following Linux concept. :)


Changes since v1
================
1. A lot of new patches.
2. Removed some TODO notes (eMMC 4.5 so no RCLK pin).
3. New clocks, more reorganization.
4. New common DTSI: exynos54xx.dtsi. I know, it is getting more
   and more complicated but this might help removing duplications
   and keeping everything under control.



Merging strategy
================
The clock changes can go to clock tree. ARM changes to samsung-soc tree.
Please provide me a tag with include/dt-bindings/clock commits so I can
merge it.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
