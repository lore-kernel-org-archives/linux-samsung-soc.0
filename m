No it isn't.  It is not used by Linux at all - the only thread register
which is used is the User r/o thread register, and I've patched the
proc-v7 code to preserve that register.

The kernel doesn't use or initialize the register, so its not something
which the kernel should be concerned about.  Presumably secure devices
need to restore the secure-mode version of that register.

However, there's an extra twist here:
| On an implementation that does not include the Security Extensions all
| CP15 c12 encodings are UNDEFINED.

And a further twist is this:
| B3.12.40 c12, Vector Base Address Register (VBAR)
| When the Security Extensions are implemented and high exception vectors are
| not selected, the Vector Base Address Register, VBAR, provides the exception
| base address for exceptions that are not handled in Monitor mode, see
| Exception vectors and the exception base address on page B1-30. The high
| exception vectors always have the base address 0xFFFF0000 and are not
| affected by the value of VBAR.

Since we always select high exception vectors, VBAR is not used, so we have
no requirement to save and restore this register on any ARMv7 MMU platform.
Given that it would be dangerous to do so (due to not knowing whether
security stuff is implemented or not) ignoring the presence of this register
is for the best.
