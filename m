Right, this need to be somehow worked out, but frankly right now I don't 
have
good idea which code should do it. The only idea that comes to my mind 
is using
a BUS_NOTIFY_BOUND_DRIVER notifier, but I don't like this approach.

I'm open for any solution that will cover this case. Maybe my idea of iommu
reserved regions is a bit over-engineered? Maybe instead of defining 
reserved
ranges it will be enough to add something like 
'iommu-on-boot-identity-mapping'
property? This way one can later use it for IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY 
approach or
something else what will be agreed?

Right, loop is missing in the above calls.

I would really like to have something working soon, it's been a lot of 
discussion but still
very little of code that actually implements anything...
