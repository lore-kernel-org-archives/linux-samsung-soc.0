There are some limitations to that, and you also have to apply common
sense and taste. In theory you could argue that a compatible string can
identify a board uniquely the same way that a board number did, and
everything else is implied by that. Clearly that's not what we want.
On the other end of the scale, you could eliminate a lot of compatible
strings if you describe each register or each bit in some cases in
DT properties, and that would be just as wrong.

Right, this would make sense.

On principle, I would not take things out of the match list, if that
would break booting with old DT file that don't list "samsung,exynos"
as compatible. But for new SoCs that would work.

Using soc_is_exynos*() too much of course also isn't good. A lot of
the things tested for should probably be checked from individual DT
properties, but again we have to find the right balance. I wouldn't
mind getting rid of the soc_is_exynos*() macros completely, because
a) we can't use them in device drivers
b) all platform code is supposed to be in drivers
c) both rules are enforced for arm64

I don't think that's necessary. If you get that part wrong, normally
all your hopes are lost with the rest of the information in DT. ;-)
