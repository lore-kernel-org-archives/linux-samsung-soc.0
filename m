It is certainly a problem related to restoring L2 control registers in
plat-samsung/s5p-sleep.S, probably DT init misses some registers
(prefetch and power control) that are restored to zero values most
likely, or the cluster cannot be shut down owing to those values not
being programmed properly. Chander posted a patch to fix that but I could
not follow that thread, I have no idea where he got to and if that fixes
the issue, I think so.
