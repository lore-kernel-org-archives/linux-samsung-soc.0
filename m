Rob, I am trying to implement the dts layout you suggested (see below),
but I find it is very hard to it due to the device is still not created,
without device, it is hard to manage the resources under this device (
Eg, de-initialization for probe deferral case). So, a common driver
is suitable for this power sequence case.

&usbotg1 {
        vbus-supply = <&reg_usb_otg1_vbus>;
        pinctrl-names = "default";
        pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_usb_otg1_id>;
        status = "okay";

        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;
        hub: genesys@1 {
                compatible = "usb5e3,608";
                reg = <1>;
                reset-gpios = <&gpio4 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>; /* hub reset pin */
                reset-duration-us = <10>;
                clocks = <&clks IMX6SX_CLK_CKO>;
        };
};
