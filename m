The problem is that, it is panel not supported by kernel. Is it possible 
to support without adding a new driver for it ? I know there is a 
simple-dpi for MIPI, but what is for parallel video or lvds?

The other problem is that I don't how to configure the display-times, 
the datasheet for CLAA070WP03XG only talk about total time, active time 
and blank time for both Horizontal an Vertical time. Does it mean the 
front-porch and sync-len for horizontal and vertical are zero ?
