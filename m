Yeah, completely agree with Linus on the visibility problem and that's=20
exactly the reason why we don't include <stdint.h> in the kernel header=
=20
and expect userspace to define the ISO types somewhere.

But using the types from "include/linux/types.h" and especially=20
including it into the uapi headers doesn't make the situation better,=20
but rather worse.

With this step we not only make the headers depend on another header=20
that isn't part of the uapi, but also pollute the user space namespace=20
with __sXX and __uXX types which aren't defined anywhere else.

Regards,
Christian.
