How about this?

broken-cd: No CD available, use polling.

cd-gpios: The CD pin on the host is working and brought out to a GPIO.

external-cd-gpios: The CD pin on the host is broken, but there's an
                   independent external GPIO available.


(Each host should only have one of these properties.)
                   
Thanks,

- Chris.
