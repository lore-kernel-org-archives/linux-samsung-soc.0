I asked whether you tried this, whether setting real 1.8V works fine.
You did not respond. As you can see on Odroid schematics, the VDDQ for
MMC[01] operates under 1.8V.

The VDDQ for MMC2 - under 2.8V.

In commit description you mentioned that this voltage "helps scale the
required voltage to detect and load the microSD cards". What does it
mean "help"? I would expect that detecting and loading of microSD cards
either works or does not work. I am not sure how does it help.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
