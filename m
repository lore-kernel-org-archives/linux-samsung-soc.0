I do not understand what you want to achieve. I added 2 trip points in
polling mode for the CPU cooling mode. Just describe the problem and
send the patch - it is the best way to explain one's thought...

cpu0_thermal is attached to tmu_cpu0 which is the temperature of CPU4
(first big core). I do not see reason behind connecting thermal zone
(thus temperature) of CPU4 with frequency of LITTLE cluster (CPU0-3). In
case of busy CPU4, you will scale down CPU0-3. Does not make sense.

I am sorry, I do not understand the idea, the problem nor the solution.

Best regards,
