Great! Clearly, I haven't fully catched up since the holidays. :-)

Only parent devices are being considered in
pm_runtime_force_suspend|resume(). Meaning that the runtime PM usage
count will not be updated for a device's link, even if it should.

I guess what happens is that the pl330 controller will be brought up
to full power during system resume, even if it isn't necessary to do
so. If that's the case, it's not the end of the world, we can optimize
it later on.

Note, this is very theoretical and to be sure, I need to run some
tests and think more about it.

Likely we can consider them as optimizations. See comment above.
