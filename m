Thanks.

Hmmm, I cc'd Kukjin on this patch as he was the one Acking most of the
patches on this driver recently (had a look at git log). Also looked
at MAINTAINERS and the driver itself to look for maintainers, and
kukjin was all I can find. Yes, get_maintainers gave the two names you
added, but many a times it generates list longer than required and so
I don't completely depend on that.

Anyway, thanks.

Let me clarify the purpose of this patch and the series.

Its only about breaking the older ->set_mode() callback into state
based callbacks and not change the way things were done. And so no
improvements in this patch. If there are improvements possible on the
driver, then they must be done separately.

Its a callback from clockevents core, and we can't get rid of the
argument. :)

That's the way ->set_mode() was doing it and so I didn't touched it to
keep this patch simple.

Ofcourse, but that has to be fixed for many routines and should be
done in a separate patch. It doesn't belong to this one.

I hope so.

I agree.. But again, that has to be done in a separate patch.

Sure..

That will be good.
