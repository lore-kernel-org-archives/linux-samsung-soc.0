In this case people using SImple FB are not really using an officially
sanctioned device tree.  The simple-fb fragment is created on the fly
via a "DO NOT SUBMIT" patch sitting on a code review server.  It's not
something that's shipped with real firmware nor is it something
present in the kernel.  See
<https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/49358/2/board/samsung/smdk5250/smdk5250.c>
as I mentioned above.

Is this really a device tree that we need to guarantee backward
compatibility with?
