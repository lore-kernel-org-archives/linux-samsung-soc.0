Well, I think this reasoning makes lots of sense! Clearly we wouldn't
be able to guarantee that there's isn't a glitch in an undefined HW
behaviour.

I will drop my suggested approach and try out another one.

Thanks for sharing your experience!

Now, I should allow you to get back to the original review! :-)

Kind regards
