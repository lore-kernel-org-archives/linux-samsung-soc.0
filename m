I've reverted this series because of following.

In file included from arch/arm/mach-tegra/cpuidle-tegra114.c:17:0:
arch/arm/mach-tegra/cpuidle-tegra114.c: In function 
'tegra114_idle_power_down':
arch/arm/include/asm/firmware.h:64:24: error: too few arguments to 
function 'firmware_ops->do_idle'
   ((firmware_ops->op) ? firmware_ops->op(__VA_ARGS__) : (-ENOSYS))
                         ^

'call_firmware_op'
   if (call_firmware_op(do_idle) == -ENOSYS)

Caused by commit f5217f3b9332 ("ARM: EXYNOS: add AFTR mode support to
firmware do_idle method").

Need to fix...
