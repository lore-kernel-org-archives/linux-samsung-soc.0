Yes.

For LDO22 there is no consumer so these are the constraints. Leaving
them undefined (here and in DTS for X/X2) would result in the same
effect. The point is that these values are valid constraints. Please
have in mind that the binding describe this as "smallest/largest voltage
consumer may set" which is true for the code above.

What about X/X2?

Since all of the boards define them, it does not bring any difference
having it here... so I can remove them.

Consistency of naming is nice but in the same time we want the regulator
names to match the hardware because it is easier to read the code and
check the schematics. On the schematics this is unfortunately called
P3V3. :)
