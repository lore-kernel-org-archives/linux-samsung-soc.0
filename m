Yes, you are right, even we do not add check for NULL on "np" it won't
cause NULL pointer exception on of_iomap(), and it handles it
gracefully, I have given explanation about this on patch [4/4] as
reply to Alim.

So we can safely avoid check for NULL on "np" without assuming
anything, but at the same time I noticed that in case of_iomap returns
NULL, we can't move ahead and configure secondary startup address in
exynos_smp_prepare_cpus, so I will resubmit [3/4] and [4/4] with
appropriate changes to take care of this case. If you see any other
concern please let me know.

Thanks,
