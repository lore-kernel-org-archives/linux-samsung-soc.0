I think this is right time when I can say "If only I had known about
it before!".
That's quite interesting especially about temperature issues.
Maybe it's worth to insert comments in driver/docs about this.

Alim, could you please add details if any?

I possess no knowledge if there're any different hw revisions of
odroid-xu3 on the field
but looks like arch timer works fine for me on odroid-xu3 Exynos5422
SoC with upstream kernel.
Is it right direction to switch xu3 to arch timer?
Do you have any info or ideas about enabling MCT G_TCON register to
start arch timer
and what's the best way to do it?

Thanks.
