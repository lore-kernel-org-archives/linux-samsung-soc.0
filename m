I don't dispute the need. I claim that the implementation is wrong, and
will fail given the right timings.

Sure. My point is you are diverting the GIC extension from its purpose,
which is mostly to be able to control wake-up sources (as for example in
the Tegra case). Here, you use this hooks to work around the fact that
the GIC driver is written with banking in mind, which is quite a
different thing.

If you really insist on using the GIC common code, then I'd suggest to
adapt it to your needs instead of working around the problem.
What about making cpu_base a percpu field inside struct gic_chip_data?
No hook abuse, and no race conditions. You could also do that for
dist_base, as it looks to be required for the 4412.
