I think there is a bug in the memory parsing code and already two people
have submitted independent fixes for that. It really should just work
even if you have more memory that ends up getting ignored.

I would definitely leave on exynos5440 support in defconfig. It's not a
lot of extra code, and if you have a system with less than 4GB memory,
you really don't want to enable LPAE because of the overhead.

Upstream I think we support exynos, vexpress (using A15, A7 and A12
core tiles), omap5 (partially), mvebu (Armada XP), highbank (Midway)
and some of the shmobile parts we added in 3.10.

In mach-sunxi, there will soon be support for Allwinner-A20 and -A31,
which are both Cortex-A7 based. MSM also has support for Cortex-A7
but not upstream. A couple of new platforms are under discussion
already that will also have LPAE, mostly server parts.
