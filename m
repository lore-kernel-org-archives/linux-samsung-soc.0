I'm really not surprised.

The CPU notifier is called via notify_cpu_starting(), which is called
with interrupts disabled, and a reason code of CPU_STARTING.  Interrupts
at this point /must/ remain disabled.

The Exynos code then goes on to call exynos4_local_timer_setup() which
tries to reverse the free_irq() in exynos4_local_timer_stop() by calling
request_irq().  Calling request_irq() with interrupts off has never been
permissible.

So, this code is wrong today, and it was also wrong when it was written.
It /couldn't/ have been tested.  It looks like this commit added this
buggy code:

    ARM: EXYNOS4: Divorce mct from local timer API

    Separate the mct local timers from the local timer API. This will
    allow us to remove ARM local timer support in the near future and
    gets us closer to moving this driver to drivers/clocksource.

A good question would be: why doesn't this happen at boot time when CPU1
is first brought up?  The conditions here are no different from hotplugging
CPU1 back in.  Do you see a similar warning on boot too?
