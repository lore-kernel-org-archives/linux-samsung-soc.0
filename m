No problem, I can move it to a special header.  Actually, if you dislike
this as an API, it does not have to be in header at all.  I can just
duplicate the simplefb code.

Hm, so maybe passing names like:

usb3503@08 {
	reset-gpios = <&gpx3 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	initial-mode = <1>;
	vdd-supply = <&buck8_reg>;
	foo-supply = <&buck9_reg>;

        power-sequence;
	power-sequence-supplies = "vdd", "foo";
};

but this is getting against initial idea of not adding any
power-sequence properties.

Sure, I'll add it if this approach is acceptable.  At this moment this
is not necessary to show my idea so I prefer to avoid doing work which
might be discarded very fast by review.

Thanks for feedback!

Best regards,
Krzysztof
