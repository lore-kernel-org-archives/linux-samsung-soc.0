Are you mixing up the persistent_clock and sched_clock here? From a 
generic stand-point they have different requirements.

No, you shouldn't see timekeeping being incremented twice, we check in 
rtc_resume code if the persistent clock is present if so we won't inject 
any measured suspend time there. But you're probably right that we're 
being a little overly paranoid checking the same value twice.

As far as the benefit to the persistent clock: it is just a little 
better to use, since we can access it earlier in resume, prior to 
interrupts being enabled. So we should see less time error introduced 
each suspend.
