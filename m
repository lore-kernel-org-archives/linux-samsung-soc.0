As to "fitting Linux", it seems to match what Linux does fairly well
(see the kvm-arm64/gicv3 branch in my tree). Not saying that it does it
in a very simple way (far from it, actually), but it works.

As to "what it is good for" (and before someone bursts into an Edwin
Starr interpretation), it mostly has to do with isolation, and the fact
that you may want to let the whole MSI programming to a guest (and yet
ensure that the guest cannot generate interrupts that would be assigned
to other devices). This is done by sampling the requester-id at the ITS
level, and use this information to index a per-device interrupt
translation table (I could talk for hours about the concept and its
variations, mostly using expletives and possibly a hammer, but I think
it is the time for my pink pill).

Indeed. GICv[34] is the ARM way of implementing MSI on SBSA compliant
systems (from level 1 onwards, if memory serves well). People are
actively building systems with this architecture, and relying on it to
provide VM isolation.

Yeah, I've been looking at that. For some restricted cases, the irqchip
model works very well (think of wire to "MSI" translators, which are
likely to have a fixed configuration). Anything more dynamic requires a
more evolved infrastructure, but I'd hope they would also be on a
discoverable bus, removing most of the need for description in DT.
