Changes since V5:
*Rebased the patchset against kernel 3.3-rc4
*Added correct flag for exynos4210 evt1 based board
*Removed CONFIG_OF from l2 cache configuration as suggested by 
 Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>

Changes since V4:
*Rebased the patchset against for-next of samsung kernel tree.
*Added Tushar suggestion of putting a check if L2 cache dt node not found.
*Added Inder suggestion of removing the BUG_ON check in cpuidle driver.

Changes since V3:
*Implemented Russell feedback and moved sleep magic 4byte memory before 
s3c_cpu_resume to data section.

Changes since V2:
*Implemented the suggestion of MyungJoo Ham and used INFORM0/1
registers for resume for some board versions.
*Added back save/restore through CPU PM notifiers as suggested by 
Lorenzo Pieralisi. This is useful to restore vfp state.
*some patch modularization (s5p/exynos) and proper commit logs.  

Changes since V1:
*rebased the whole patch against 3.2-rc1 tree
*removed GIC save/restore in AFTR cpuidle state as it is external
to cpu powerdomain
*Added L2 setup code through device tree
*Removed only l2 save/restore registers in sleep

This Patch series adds support for AFTR mode cpuidle state based on
patch (http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg132243.html) earlier
submitted by Jaecheol Lee <jc.lee@samsung.com>.

This patch uses CPU PM notifiers , common l2 save/restore and
new cpu_suspend/resume interfaces and is based on the tip of
master branch of kernel.org tree(v3.3-rc4)

Amit Daniel Kachhap (5):
  ARM: exynos: Add support AFTR mode on EXYNOS4210
  ARM: s5p: add L2 early resume code
  ARM: exynos: save L2 settings during bootup
  ARM: exynos: remove useless code to save/restore L2
  ARM: exynos: Enable l2 configuration through device tree
