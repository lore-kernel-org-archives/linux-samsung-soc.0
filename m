Hi,

Thanks for adding my Thomasz,

Just to mention: this is actually not board specific.  No exynos
products support more than one slot.  ...and in fact apparently NOBODY
supports more than one slot.  I have a plan to post up a patch
removing multislot support whenever I have a free moment.

Anyway, what you did is fine.

Right, not board-specific.  This is SoC specific.  Interestingly
enough you appear to have it wrong.  I have it on good authority that
5420 has a FIFO depth of 0x40 not 0x80.  Apparently the FIFO is 0x40
deep and 64 wide whereas the old FIFO is 0x80 deep and 32 wide.

These ARE board specific, actually.  ...and Tomasz has pointed out.

Note: I have information that says that these timings are not correct
and that nearly always the "drive" timing should be 0 and the sample
timing 4.  ...but we haven't landed that change ourselves yet, so
maybe keeping the timings you have is right.
