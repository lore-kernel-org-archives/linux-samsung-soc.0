As long as you don't have read-only firmware 90.0 then the known bug
is fixed.  If you have 90.0 it's pretty easy to pull our your write
protect screw and update your read-only firmware if you're doing
development.

...but of course it's never been tested, so there might be other bugs.
 The known bug that was fixed was found solely by code inspection (a
missing break statement in a switch).
