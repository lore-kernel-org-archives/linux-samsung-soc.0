Handling the special clock 'sclk_sata' is another issue.
Please, look at that other 'sclk_*'s are handled.
Also, if possible, please add 'the code handling the special clock'
to 'ahci_platform.c'.

As Roger Quadros mentioned, 'ti_sata' driver will be dropped.

'ahci_imx' is necessary, because 'ahci_imx' controls some
specific registers.

However, 'ahci_exynos.c' does not control any registers.

I think that the platform specific driver like ahci_xxx.c is not
necessary, because 'ahci_exynos.c' does not control any special
registers.
