I don't get it. The patch you are referring to has a proper "From"
field. So please use it as an example.

Are you sure? I think the driver is used on almost all of Exynos SoCs
(Exynos4, Exynos5250, Exynos542x).

Untested code should not go to the kernel. Additionally you should
mark it as not-tested. Marking such patch as non-tested could help you
finding some independent tests (tests performed by someone else).

To summarize my point of view:
1. Unless Vivek's says otherwise, please give him the credits with
proper "from" field.
2. Issues mentioned in previous mail should be addressed (missing
IS_ERR(), how disabling the regulator during suspend affects waking
up).
3. The patchset must be tested, even after rebasing.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
