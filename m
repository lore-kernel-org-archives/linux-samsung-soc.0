I'm aware of Thomas work and probably will integrate it when finally it
is merged.

In the __cpufreq_add_dev() you have cpufreq_driver->ready() callback
which in the cpufreq-dt.c has call to of_cpufreq_cooling_register().

It seems like cpufreq-dt is ready for handling cpu cooling devices.

Is your board Odroid-U3/Trats2 ?

I'm not surprised, that some use cases (about which I wasn't even
aware) show up. 
I've already fixed issues reported by Abhilash (with v5 and a following
patch) and look closer into the THERMAL_HWMON.

I've also done some work regarding FAN controlled by hwmon for Odroid
U3.
Could you look on following series:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-samsung-soc/msg40471.html

I can only guess that your board might need similar entries for your
DTS file(s).

Thanks for testing the patch set :-)
