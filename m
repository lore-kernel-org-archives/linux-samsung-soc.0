System MMU is dedicated to a master H/W such as FIMD and FIMC.
Thus, attaching a master H/W to an iommu domain can be thought as
attaching a System MMU to an iommu domain even though such thinking
is not correct view of the relationship between iommu domain and
System MMU.

System MMU is responsible for address translation of traffic from a
master H/W which the System MMU is dedicated to.

Sorry, I don't understand.
Do you mean you are thinking that it is better to share one page table
by all IOMMUs in a system?
