Hi Stephen,

Krzysztof has left Samsung, but we would like to continue this task, because
the ABBA dead-locks related to global prepare lock becomes more and more
problematic for us to workaround.

This was not phrased well but the idea was to let provider/controller
have ability to define which clocks will use common lock. Probably
removing the concept of clock controller and moving the lock to
clk_provider will be much better approach.

Right, such change requires much more documentation and especially
that it took significant amount of time to figure out all(?)
possible use cases and locking schemes.

Well, switching from a single global lock to more granular locking
is always a good approach. Please note that the global lock sooner
or later became a serious bottleneck if one wants to make somehow
more aggressive power management and clock gating.

Do you have any plan to continue working on your approach? per-clk
wwmutex looks like an overkill on the first glance, but that's probably
the only working solution if you want to get rid of recursive locks.
I'm still not really convinced that we really need wwmutex here,
especially if it is possible to guarantee the same order of locking
operations inside the clock core. This requires a bit of cooperation
from clock providers (with proper documentation and a list of
DO/DON'T it shouldn't be that hard).

I'm not sure that this makes really sense split consumers and
providers. You will get recursive calls to clk core anyway with
consumers calls if you are implementing i2c clock, for which an i2c
bus driver does it's own clock gating (i2c controller uses
consumer clk api).
