Looks good to me. Two small requests:

a) if you don't mind, can you add my patch (1/2) to add support for s3c64xx to
   your series, adding your Signed-off-by line in addition to mine? I think
   that one was noncontroversial, while the second patch (2/2) need some more
   work to address the comments and do testing.

b) For the "compatible" string, I think it makes sense to set a fallback to
   "samsung,exynos-adc-v2" in the case for exynos3250, making the DT
   representation

	compatible = "samsung,exynos3250-adc", "samsung,exynos-adc-v2";

   It's not entirely compatible because of the addition of the clock, but
   since the register layout is the same, I think it still make sense.

Thanks.

For the entire series,
