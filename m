Currently syscon driver is registered via postcore_initcall whereas exynos
pmu has
arch_initcall. So if we keep syscon as second compatibility in exynos pmu
node,
syscon will be registered first and hence only syscon will be probed.

Yes, this could be possible if I convert arch_initcall of exynos pmu to
postcore_initcall.

As after converting arch_initcall to postcore_initcall, syscon driver will
not be probed
for exynos pmu node. Also as exynos pmu driver will now register itself as
syscon provider,
I could not see any use of keeping second compatibility as "syscon" in
exynos pmu
node.  Do you think it is still required?

After removing "syscon" compatibility string from exynos pmu node, I have
tested
S2R as well as watchdog driver functionality, which is user of regmap handle
of exynos pmu
and both are working fine on exynos5250.

OK, let me post exynos pmu v5, based on your patch, and then if time permits
I will have a look in it.
