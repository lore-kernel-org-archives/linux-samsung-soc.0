So it's still not clear to me how this should be done correctly.

One thing that comes to my mind is precomputing register values to some
kind of structure, then calling some kind of magical platform-specific
.enable() or .configure() callback, which takes the structure and, in
one shot, configures the L2C according to firmware requirements. Then
the generic code would read back those values to verify the final
configuration (as it does right now) and rest of the operation would be
identical.

Is this something you would deem acceptable?

Best regards,
Tomasz
