I took those into account. But quite frankly they're no excuse for not
having at least a half-decent design. Even if you could guarantee that
the same IP wasn't used in a different combination than you expect,
keeping what you have now sets a very bad example and people will copy
because they don't know better and I'll have to explain this all over
again.
