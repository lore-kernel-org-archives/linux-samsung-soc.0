Sorry, but this is a hack to *try* to make multi-slot work and this
isn't sufficient. There were good reasons to why the earlier
non-working multi slot support was removed from dw_mmc.

Let me elaborate a bit for your understanding. The core uses a host
lock (mmc_claim|release_host()) to serialize operations and commands,
as to confirm to the SD/SDIO/(e)MMC specs. The above changes gives no
guarantees for this. To make that work, we would need a "mmc bus lock"
to be managed by the core.

However, inventing a "mmc bus lock" would lead to other problems
related to I/O scheduling for upper layers - it simply breaks. For
example, I/O requests for one card/slot can then starve I/O requests
reaching another card/slot.
