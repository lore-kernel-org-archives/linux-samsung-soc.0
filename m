Unfortunately I got preempted with other things to do and now I'm on
vacation. I worked a bit with Bart (added on CC) on this and generally
the conclusion was that all the things are necessary. He was also
working to extend the driver to support Exynos4x12.

Bart, has anything interesting showed up since we talked about this last
time?

Best regards,
Tomasz
