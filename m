My patches submited to Andrew Morton had the description and a note that they
have been prepared especially for his tree, taking into account all patches
that are already there (mainly a tasklets to threaded irq conversion). For me
it was quite obvious that they will be merged after all other sdhci changes
from that tree. I have no idea why the order of the patches has been reversed
and my sdhci patches has been submitted to Linus before the other sdhci
changes.
