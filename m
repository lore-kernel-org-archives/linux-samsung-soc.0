Hello Chanwoo,

thanks for the comments!

You forgot normal system reboot and shutdown, but I guess we can sort
this into category 2.

Looks like I good idea to encapsulate this. Do you think it makes sense
to base my series on your branch? I think the soonest when this series
is going to land is 4.11 anyway.

OK, so you rather see the main logic moved into
devfreq_{resume,suspend}_device().

What about my other questions?
- resume freq, yes or no?
- is the core/driver mismatch with respect to setting/using suspend_freq
an issue? (not functional, but for the design)

I think that with a bitflag we cannot avoid having some extra logic in
the device drivers to handle whatever error code we return from
devfreq_{resume,suspend}_device().

I'll take the refcount route for now.

What about this question? So you want me to refcount number of suspend?

Or should we refcount usage, i.e. we start with refcount=1 and allow
refcounts<=1 (also negative).

Again, this is more a design than a functional issue.


I'll try to post a v3 in the next days. Not sure when though, with
Christmas upcoming and all :)
