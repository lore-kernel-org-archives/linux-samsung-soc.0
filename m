You're not understanding the problem.  The problem is not at driver probe
time, the problem is at device instantiation time, which is way earlier.

We need to power up the device and enable clocks in order to read the
device's vendor and part number, which is what identifies it to the
driver.  This is also used by userspace to work out which driver module
to load.

So, we need this information to be present when the device is registered.
It's just like the PCI vendor and device IDs - in PCI, these must be
readable when the device is instantiated.

The problem that's being addressed here is that there's no way at the
moment to know when the drivers on a different bus (namely the platform
bus) have probed and are providing the clock and power domain resources
necessary to be able to read these identifying values.

I guess if you don't like a notifier, the other alternative is to
setup a delayed workqueue and have the workqueue repeatedly attempt
to register the devices until they all succeed.  That's not
particularly nice, because we'd be wasting CPU cycles running
that workqueue for no reason until all the devices get registered.
