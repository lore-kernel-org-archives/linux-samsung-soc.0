It could be handled by creating a list of offsets per compatible string and
then adding some way to identify the PHY device instance. So I believe that's
not a big issue. Now you'd be encoding a list of registers offsets in the
device tree, without encoding bit layout of each register. It's unlikely that
each instance would have different bits layout, but describing individual 
registers in DT I thought is something that we're not supposed to do.

I think it's easier from the driver POV, but isn't it violating the device
tree rules ?
Anyway. I'm just pointing this minor issue in the binding as it appears
to me. The final word of course belongs to a DT binding maintainer.
