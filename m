Does this mean that the understanding of this format is merged into
the mainline kernel drivers or is it keps out-of-tree?

That may not be as simple as it seems if all you have is the
device tree and no manual, but I get the picture.

I would prefer the above to use the nice generic enums from the
pin control subsystem's pinmux and pinconf properties in the
end so the device tree on its own is understandable without
any manual whatsoever, but we'll see about that.

Maybe I'm mistaken about the device tree ambitions, but
I was sort of hoping that it would not contain too much
custom magic numbers that need to be cross-referenced
elsewhere ... or rather - the more understandable the device
tree is, the more we win.

Thanks,
