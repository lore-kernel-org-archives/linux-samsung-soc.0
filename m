Verified.

Right.  ...but since I can't re-route, I can't use this to solve my problem.

We must not be on the same page, so I'll put all my assumptions in
super detail and we can see what's different...


So if I have "MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL" set, the MMC core will poll things,
right?  ...and you are suggesting that I could solve my vqmmc vs. card
detect problem by using MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL, right?


Let's think about the case when no card is inserted.  When no card is
inserted the core will call set_ios() with MMC_POWER_OFF, right?

...and we want that to turn off vmmc.
...and if we turn off vmmc, we should turn off vqmmc.

Now we've got vmmc off and vqmmc off and on this board we can't read
the card detect line, right?

Now, we've got MMC_CAP_NEEDS_POLL, so dw_mmc will periodically be
called to check the card detect line, but with vmmc and vqmmc off.  It
will be unable to return a sensible value without actually turning on
vmmc and vqmmc.


...so with that context, I'll ask my questoin again:

Are you suggesting that we should flip the voltage of vqmmc (and thus
vmmc to prevent damaging the card) during polling?  That seems ugly.

It was not measurable during normal running (S0).

During system PM state we actually _can_ turn power off.  We don't
need to detect card insertions at that time (card detect is not a
wakeup source on this board).
