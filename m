Just like the CTO timeout calculation introduced recently, the DTO
timeout calculation was incorrect.  It used "bus_hz" but, as far as I
can tell, it's supposed to use the card clock.  Let's account for the
div value, which is documented as 2x the value stored in the register,
or 1 if the register is 0.

NOTE: This was likely not terribly important until commit 16a34574c6ca
("mmc: dw_mmc: remove the quirks flags") landed because "DIV" is
documented on Rockchip SoCs (the ones that used to define the quirk)
to always be 0 or 1.  ...and, in fact, it's documented to only be 1
with EMMC in 8-bit DDR52 mode.  Thus before the quirk was applied to
everyone it was mostly OK to ignore the DIV value.

I haven't personally observed any problems that are fixed by this
patch but I also haven't tested this anywhere with a DIV other an 0.
AKA: this problem was found simply by code inspection and I have no
failing test cases that are fixed by it.  Presumably this could fix
real bugs for someone out there, though.
