I'll do so..

40 bit Interface setting is done through i2c. Internal setting address
0x3A and data 0x0B.

Yes, It is the i2c bus driver thats handles this case. There is a
subsequent patch
that provides the polling support to the driver. As far as I know, the
i2c controller for
HDMI PHY is also interrupt driven.
