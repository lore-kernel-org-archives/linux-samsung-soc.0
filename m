Having those clocks defined as separate entities in CCF would make them 
accessible outside the core clock, including changing their 
configuration, but they should be only changed on APLL change and 
atomically. By registering them as standard CCF clocks you are providing 
an interface to something that is not allowed.

If there was a _real_ need to have them defined as separate clocks, you 
would have to implement a separate clock type that would only allow 
retrieving the rate from it. Maybe a read-only flag for the divider 
clock could do, as mux clock already has such.

I fail to see any use cases for them. Even now from 7 of core clock 
dividers of Exynos4210, in clk-exynos4.c only div_core and div_core2 are 
defined.

Then as I noted above, the values set to those internal blocks are 
completely tied to used APLL setting and you can't change them 
separately. Any potential use case would be limited to reading the 
frequency.

This also depends on whether other entities should be able to 
reconfigure the mux in question. If it needs to be switched only when 
the APLL is reconfigured by core clock, then I don't think there is a 
need to provide access to it outside.
