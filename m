Maybe they are not a majority, but I've already found that this applies
to the following devices: OneNAND, RTC, FrameBuffer, ADC, AC97, PCM,
IIS-64xx, SPI-64xx. With the original solution all these devices will
require their own resource template per each SoC. IMHO that's both 
inconvenient and ineffective in terms of space used by kernel static
structures.

I've analyzed such solution and found that it would be hard to define
the rewrite rules in a separate array and place it into __initdata section.
You would need to create such arrays separately and put the pointers to them
in the real device table. This way you lose the advantage of having all
parameters for a single device defined in the same place, in a compact way.
A separate array for the resources wouldn't also save much space.

I don't think that 12 bytes per such simple device entry is a huge overhead.
I've currently defined maximum number of resources (S3C_MAX_RESOURCES
define) to 6, but it can be reduced to 5 if we really want to save space
as much as possible. It is just a proposition. Note that all these device
table arrays are placed in __initdata section and will be dropped once the
system boots. The resource array for the simple device would contain 4 
(or 3 if we reduce the S3C_MAX_RESOURCES to 5) zeros. Such arrays compress
quite well so it shouldn't have much impact on the kernel image size.

It would work exactly as in the current implementation. Platform devices are
instantiated during machine startup and each machine maintainer knows which
devices should be registered. This has nothing to the device drivers. They
can be built as modules and inserted later.

I'm not really sure that there are other arm platforms which has such a lot
of variants of devices, that depend on particular version of SoC.

Anyway, I will check again how this is handled on other platforms.

Thanks for your comments!
