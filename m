That was my point, there's no consumers for X/X2 and there is only a
consumer in U3 (vqmmc-supply for mshc_0) added by $SUBJECT. That's why
I thought that it should be defined in odroidu3.dts and removed from
the .dtsi.

Mmm, I see what you mean. If the regulators are not defined then these
for example won't be turned off by the regulator subsystem if were
enabled by the bootloader. Then I guess your change makes sense.

Ok. I don't have a strong opinion on this though now that I realized
that not defining some regulators could lead to unused ones not being
disabled on boot.

oh, I missed that. It's pity but I agree with you that matching the
schematics is more important that naming consistency.

Thanks a lot for your explanations, the patch looks good to me as it is now:
