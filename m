You know what? You're right.

I don't really like this cpu-clock code (and similarly I don't like
Tegra's EMC code which requires access to clk_hw_reparent). But I slept
on this issue overnight and it doesn't seem right for me to hold back
these patches when the better solution is currently vaporware (I have
some code but it's far from ready).

It occurs to me that the best decision I can take is to merge it now and
then force you guys to switch over when the new infrastructure is
available. That is more reasonable than delaying the patches getting
pulled.

So how to merge it? Viresh has given his Ack and is OK for the cpufreq
changes to go through another tree. I can take the whole thing with
Kukjin's Ack on the ARM dts patch, or we can set up an immutable
branch.

If you really want to make my life easy you can send a pull request for
these patches (and the other Exynos cpufreq/cpu-clock series).

Mike
