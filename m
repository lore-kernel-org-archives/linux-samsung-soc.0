Hi, Thomas.

OK, I know what you have done.
Actually, it was my long concern.

Current s3c-fb driver needs lcd panel resolutions, since each window's
xres, yres values can be changed by fb driver or user application.
Therefore, additional 'costant' lcd panel resolutions are necessary in order to
set timing values.

I'll review your patch.
Thank you.

Best regards,
Jingoo Han
