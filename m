Yeah, this seem odd, specially as what's currently in mainline doesn't
try to play tricks with the distributor. It looks like having a per-core
distributor address is required for PPI usage on these SoCs, but the
commit message is uninformative at best:

https://github.com/sfrothwell/linux-next/commit/637c2afa57ec9cd0ddc8879ea0cda4d8835ba71d#arch/arm/mach-exynos4/cpu.c

Again, comments from Samsung people would be much appreciated.

Unfortunately, you can't. That would be nice though... ;-)

Kukjin, could you please comment on the presence of a common memory
region for the distributor? This seem quite odd...

Thanks,
