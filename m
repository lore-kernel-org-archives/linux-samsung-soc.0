This is quite confusing.  You've already sent a patch called
"sdhci-s3c: add support for new card detection methods".  It had the
same changelog as this patch and the same title, but the two patches
are utterly different!

I suggest that you resend this patch under an appropriate title and
with a more specific changelog, please.
