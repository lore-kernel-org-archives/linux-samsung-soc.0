That's quite not true, in case of omap3 pins are labeled as R0-R7, B0-B7 and
G0-G7; what changes is pixel format.

AM335x LCDC is completely different IP altogether and spec doesn't map
Colors to pins. It barely maps bit0 from memory to pinX.
Now you call it as a standard or legacy or may be due to SGX software,
the pixel format we use is BGR (as in memory). 
It is completely depends on how you interface the pins to LCD (considering)
Software support/requirement.
