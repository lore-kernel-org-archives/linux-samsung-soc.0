If you don't want to use the controller device name to do the
matching, we can use the con_id string as well. I believe the lookup
method I use in this set just needs a small change.

Is that OK with you?

Do you mean, leave it in the platform code? Why? We would reduce the
platform code by moving it to the mfd driver. Or did I misunderstood
something?

Hope I'm not forgetting something we have talked before my vacation.
