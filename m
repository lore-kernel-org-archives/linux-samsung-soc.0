I applied these to pci/host-imx6 for v3.16.

Sorry I didn't do this sooner; I get a lot of email and it's easy to
overlook things.  I mostly work from patchwork
(http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-pci/list/?order=date), and I had
dropped this series from there because there was enough discussion that I
expected a re-post, so it wasn't on my radar screen anymore.
