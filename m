Hi Rahul, Pankaj, Arun,

[adding linux-arm-kernel, devicetree MLs and DT people on Cc]

I think it's good time to stop accepting DTS files like this and force 
new ones to use the proper structure with soc node, labels for every 
node and node references.

In case of previous Exynos 5 SoCs I hadn't complained, because they 
shared a lot of data with already existing exynos5.dtsi, but since 
Exynos5260 is completely different, I'd say it should be converted to 
the new layout.

As an example you can look at arch/arm/boot/dts/s3c64xx.dtsi and files 
that include it or, for more complete structures, DTS of other 
platforms, such as imx6*.

Btw. Please remember that linux-samsung-soc mailing list is just a 
convenient utility for reviewers of Samsung-specific patches to have all 
of them in one place. Sending patches to it alone is not enough - a 
general kernel ML list needs to be CCed as well, in this case 
linux-arm-kernel.

Also, please see my comments inline, for review comments unrelated to 
the issue described above.

What is the reason for SPI0 to have 4 pins, while SPI1 has just 3?

nit: Please make this consistent with CPUs 10x below, by using hex here 
as well.

nit: Please keep 1 blank line of spacing between nodes.

I don't think there is a need to group these nodes under a parent node 
that doesn't give any additional information, especially when the CMUs 
are scattered trough the whole address space, while we'd like to keep 
the nodes ordered by their addresses, as most platforms do.

I don't think that having the "samsung,exynos5260-clock" compatible 
string for every CMU is appropriate here, because there is no way to 
automatically recognize which CMU it is. Since every CMU instance is 
different, they need to have different compatible strings.

MCT is not an interrupt controller, so the 2 properties above are incorrect.

There is no need for interrupt-map here, because all the interrupts are 
from GIC.

nit: It might be more readable to use decimal 64 here.
